So a really sunny day (cloud cover column), all the solar power systems open up to capture as much solar energy and store for really cloudy days. Or for high temperature days (temperature column), systems that convert heat energy to electric energy will activate (Thermoelectric devices are made from materials that can convert a temperature difference into electricity, without requiring any moving parts).
