    "In this lab, you will be working with the 2018 [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/). The GSS is a sociological survey created and regularly collected since 1972 by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. It is funded by the National Science Foundation. The GSS collects information and keeps a historical record of the concerns, experiences, attitudes, and practices of residents of the United States, and it is one of the most important data sources for the social sciences. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data includes features that measure concepts that are notoriously difficult to ask about directly, such as religion, racism, and sexism. The data also include many different metrics of how successful a person is in his or her profession, including income, socioeconomic status, and occupational prestige. These occupational prestige scores are coded separately by the GSS.  The full description of their methodology for measuring prestige is available here: http://gss.norc.org/Documents/reports/methodological-reports/MR122%20Occupational%20Prestige.pdf Here's a quote to give you an idea about how these scores are calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Respondents then were given small cards which each had a single occupational titles listed on it. Cards were in English or Spanish. They were given one card at a time in the preordained order. The interviewer then asked the respondent to \"please put the card in the box at the top of the ladder if you think that occupation has the highest possible social standing. Put it in the box of the bottom of the ladder if you think it has the lowest possible social standing. If it belongs somewhere in between, just put it in the box that matches the social standing of the occupation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The prestige scores are calculated from the aggregated rankings according to the method described above."
