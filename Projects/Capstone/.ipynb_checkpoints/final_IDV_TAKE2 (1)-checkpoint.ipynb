RAKOFF, U.S.D.J.: The plaintiffs in these three related cases are two  anonymous women, referred to here as \"JPM Jane Doe\"  and [*4]  \"DB Jane Doe,\" and the Government of the  United States Virgin Islands (the \"USVI\"). Plaintiffs claim  that defendants JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"JP  Morgan\") and the related entities Deutsche Bank  Aktiengesellschaft, Deutsche Bank AG New York  Branch, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas  (collectively, \"Deutsche Bank\") are legally liable for their  alleged facilitation of Jeffrey Epstein's sex crimes. On February 1, 2023, and February 7, 2023, defendants  filed motions to dismiss the operative complaints in each  case. After full consideration of the parties' written  submissions and oral arguments, the Court granted  those motions in part and denied those motions in part  by a \"bottom-line order\" dated March 20, 2023. This  Opinion reconfirms the Court's rulings and explains the  reasoning behind them. I. Plaintiffs' Allegations  A. Jeffrey Epstein's Sex-Trafficking Operation Plaintiffs allege that between 2006 and 2018, DB Jane  Doe and JPM Jane Doe were Jeffrey Epstein's sex  slaves. He raped them repeatedly, and he sexually [*5]   abused them in other ways as well. JPM Jane Doe FAC,  ¶ 99; DB Jane Doe FAC, ¶ 128. He kept them in his  thrall through a combination of promises, payments, and  threats: promises to advance their careers and  educations, payments in cash and in kind, and threats to  destroy them if they did not obey his demands. JPM  Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 70, 96, 111; DB Jane Doe FAC, ¶  139, 143. These Jane Does were not alone. Plaintiffs allege that  beginning in 1998 and continuing until 2019, over two  decades later, Epstein ran an organization that recruited  hundreds of young women and girls and coerced them  into performing sex acts. JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 62, 67,  76; DB Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 39, 40, 88. Typically, Epstein  would lure a victim to one of his residences by  promising to grant a wish, would then pressure her into  performing massages that became increasingly sexual,  and then would force her to participate in sex acts on a  continuing basis. JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶ 66; DB Jane  Doe FAC, ¶ 107. Cash was the lifeblood of Epstein's operation. Victims  were paid hundreds of dollars, in cash, each time  Epstein abused them; and they were also paid hundreds  of dollars, in cash, for each additional victim that they  recruited. [*6]  JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 66, 68; DB Jane  Doe FAC, ¶¶ 52-53, 115. At times, plaintiffs allege,  Epstein dispensed thousands of dollars in cash every           2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *2 Page 9 of 23 day to his victims, amounting to, on average $200,000  per year. DB Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 54, 280-81; USVI FAC,  ¶ 80. Epstein could not have run his operation, plaintiffs  claim, without ready access to cash through the banking  system. B. JP Morgan's Alleged Involvement JP Morgan began to serve as Jeffrey Epstein's principal  bank as early as 1998. JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶ 41; USVI  FAC, ¶ 41. Eventually, both Epstein and at least a  dozen entities affiliated with Epstein and his operation  maintained bank accounts with JP Morgan. USVI FAC,  ¶ 27. These accounts, plaintiffs allege, were highly  lucrative for JP Morgan and essential to Jeffrey  Epstein's sex-trafficking operation. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that JP Morgan supported  Epstein's sex-trafficking operation in four different ways.  First, they allege that JP Morgan enabled Epstein to  access the large quantities of cash that fueled his  operation. JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶ 45; USVI FAC, ¶ 103.  Second, they allege that JP Morgan assisted Epstein  with \"structuring\" his cash withdrawals so as to elude  suspicion. [*7]  JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶ 179; USVI FAC,  ¶ 67. Third, plaintiffs allege that JP Morgan did not  timely file suspicious activity reports (\"SARs\") that would  have alerted authorities to Jeffrey Epstein's sex- trafficking operation. JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 180-81;  USVI FAC, ¶¶ 74-75. In particular, plaintiffs allege that  JP Morgan delayed filing SARs for \"thousands of  transactions . . . totaling more than $1 billion, including  payments to dozens of women, often with Eastern  European surnames.\" USVI FAC, ¶ 75. Finally, plaintiffs  allege that a JP Morgan subsidiary, Highbridge Capital  Management, transported young women and girls from  Florida to Epstein in New York, on the company's  private jet. JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶ 170. According to the plaintiffs, by no later than 2006, JP  Morgan either actually knew or should have known that  it was supporting a sexual predator. JPM Jane Doe  FAC, ¶¶ 190, 196. In 2006, police reports and news  articles revealed that Epstein had sexually abused  dozens of young women and girls. Id at 190. In 2008,  Epstein pled guilty to sex offenses, including soliciting a  minor for prostitution, and he registered as a sex  offender. USVI FAC, ¶ 38. Following Epstein's guilty  plea, dozens of public [*8]  lawsuits were filed against  him, which included detailed accusations of his sexual  abuse of young women and girls. JPM Jane Doe FAC,  ¶¶ 207-209. While JP Morgan allegedly was aware of  several of these accusations, JP Morgan nonetheless  continued to bank Epstein. USVI FAC, ¶ 44. After Epstein was released from prison, accusations that  he trafficked young women and girls continued to  surface. Plaintiffs allege that employees within JP  Morgan would occasionally report these accusations to  their superiors and would ask whether JP Morgan  should maintain its relationship with Epstein. In 2010, for  example, JP Morgan's risk management division  discussed new allegations against Epstein: \"See below  new allegations of an investigation related to child  trafficking — are you still comfortable with this client  who is now a registered sex offender?\" USVI FAC, ¶ 45.  In January 2011, JP Morgan's director of anti-money  laundering compliance requested re-approval for the  bank's relationship with Epstein from JP Morgan's then- General Counsel \"in light of the new allegations of  human trafficking . . .\" Id. at ¶ 46. And there were other alleged red flags. Epstein and/or  his associates are alleged to have [*9]  made significant  cash withdrawals from JP Morgan accounts with no  known payee. USVI FAC, ¶ 67. For example, Hyperion  Air, Inc. -- the Epstein-controlled company that owned  Epstein's private jet -- issued over $547,000 in checks  payable to cash purportedly for \"fuel expenses when  traveling to foreign countries.\" Id. Additionally, JP  Morgan accounts in the name of Epstein's affiliated  charitable organizations made payments without a clear  connection to those organizations' charitable purposes.  For example, Epstein and/or his representative used the  C.O.U.Q. Foundation account to pay $29,464.66 to  three young women, including two people known to be  Epstein's victims. USVI FAC, ¶ 68. One final source of JP Morgan's alleged knowledge is  James (\"Jes\") Staley. Circa 2000, Mr. Staley headed  JP Morgan's private banking division, and he began to  service Epstein's account. JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶ 131.  Mr. Staley is alleged to have developed a close  personal friendship with Epstein. Indeed, Mr. Staley  once wrote to Epstein, \"I deeply appreciate our  friendship. I have few so profound.\" USVI FAC, ¶ 56.  Later, while Epstein was still a JP Morgan client, Mr.  Staley was promoted to be CEO of JP Morgan  Asset [*10]  Management. Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Staley had first-hand knowledge  of Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking operation. Mr. Staley       2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *6 Page 10 of 23 is alleged to have visited Epstein's residences several  times while that operation was ongoing, and, during  these visits, observed JPM Jane Doe \"as a sexual  trafficking and abuse victim.\" JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶  115. On December 5, 2009, one day after Mr. Staley  visited Epstein in New York, Epstein emailed Mr. Staley  to say, \"you were with Larry, and I had to put up with . .  .\" and attached a picture of a young woman in a  sexually suggestive pose. USVI FAC, ¶ 58. On  December 20, 2009, Epstein sent to Mr. Staley an email  that consisted entirely of a picture of a young woman.  Id. at ¶ 59. Plaintiffs further allege that Mr. Staley himself abused  some of Epstein's victims, including JPM Jane Doe  herself. JPM Jane Doe claims that \"one of Epstein's  friends\" -- whom she later identified as Mr. Staley --  \"used aggressive force in his sexual assault of her and  informed [JPM Jane Doe] that he had Epstein's  permission to do what he wanted to her.\" JPM Jane Doe  FAC, ¶ 107. And the USVI asserts that it possesses  email correspondence between Epstein and Mr.  Staley [*11]  which suggests, albeit cryptically, that Mr.  Staley had sexual encounters while visiting Epstein. In  July 2010, Mr. Staley emailed Epstein, \"That was fun.  Say hi to Snow White.\" To which Epstein responded:  \"[W]hat character would you like next?\" Mr. Staley  answered: \"Beauty and the Beast.\" USVI FAC, ¶ 61. C. Deutsche Bank's Alleged Involvement In 2013, a JP Morgan compliance officer terminated JP  Morgan's relationship with Epstein. USVI FAC, ¶ 63.  Epstein then went on the market for a new bank. Shortly before then, Paul Morris, a banker with JP  Morgan who had serviced Epstein's accounts, left JP  Morgan and joined Deutsche Bank. DB Jane Doe FAC,  at ¶ 202. Mr. Morris suggested to Deutsche Bank's  senior management that a relationship with Epstein  could be very lucrative: banking Epstein could generate  millions of dollars in fees, and it could also lead to  further relationships with Epstein's wealthy friends. Id. Deutsche Bank took on Epstein as a client on August  19, 2013. DB Jane Doe FAC, ¶ 210. Eventually,  Epstein, his related entities, and his associates opened  and funded more than 40 accounts at Deutsche Bank,  which held more than $110 million in assets. Id. at ¶  210.   DB Jane Doe alleges [*12]  that Epstein used his  Deutsche Bank accounts much as he did his accounts  with JP Morgan. He used them to withdraw cash to pay  off his victims and associates. Id. at ¶¶ 52-53, 115. He  solicited Deutsche Bank's advice about how to structure  his withdrawals so as to evade notice. Id. at ¶¶ 229-239.  And he was shielded by Deutsche Bank's failure to file  suspicious activity reports. Id. at ¶ 324. DB Jane Doe likewise alleges that Deutsche Bank either  knew or should have known that Epstein used his  Deutsche Bank accounts to power his sex-trafficking  operation. In April 2013, after Mr. Morris proposed  taking on Epstein as a client, a junior relationship  coordinator assigned to the Epstein account prepared a  memorandum which noted various risks posed by a  relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. This memorandum  noted that \"Epstein was charged with soliciting an  underage prostitution [sic] in 2007,\" that \"[h]e served 13  months out of his 18-month sentence,\" and that \"[h]e  was accused of paying young woman [sic] for massages  in his Florida home.\" Id. at ¶ 52. Around the same time,  a  Deutsche  Bank  compliance  officer  performed  background checks on the beneficiaries of one of  Epstein's entities, the Butterfly [*13]  Trust. Id. at ¶ 216.  This check revealed that one of the beneficiaries, Sarah  Kellen, was named as one of Epstein's co-conspirators  in a related criminal case. Id. Once Deutsche Bank began to serve as Epstein's bank,  it allegedly continued to receive red flags. Between  2014 and 2015, DB's Anti-Financial Crime department  alerted DB's senior management to issues concerning  Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking. DB Jane Doe FAC, ¶  206. In May 2018, one of Deutsche Bank's compliance  officers asked a relationship manager assigned to  Epstein's account about payments to \"accounts of  women with Eastern European surnames at a Russian  Bank.\" An accountant at Deutsche Bank, who was  looped into the conversation, replied that the money  was \"SENT TO A FRIEND FOR TUITION FOR  SCHOOL.\" Id. at ¶ 226. The compliance officer did not  ask any follow-up questions, and the transaction was  cleared. Id. at ¶ 227. And Epstein's personal attorney  withdrew over $800,000 in cash on Epstein's behalf over  a four-year period, on multiple occasions asking about  the maximum amount that could be withdrawn without  triggering a reporting requirement. Id. at ¶¶ 231-32. The  attorney's only explanation for these withdrawals  was [*14]  that Epstein needed cash for travel, tipping,  and expenses. Id. D. Plaintiffs' Claims 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *10 Page 11 of 23 In total, plaintiffs assert 28 claims against the  defendants. Several of these claims are brought under  the federal Trafficking Victims Protection ACT (\"TVPA\").  Others assert violations of the federal Racketeering  Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\") and  the USVI's territorial-law analogue to RICO, the Virgin  Islands Criminally Influenced and Corrupt Organizations  Act (\"CICO\"). A final statutory claim alleges a violation of  the Virgin Islands Consumer Fraud and Deceptive  Business Practices Act (\"CFDBPA\"). Plaintiffs assert a  variety of state tort claims as well. II. Discussion HN1[ ] \"To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint  must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true,  to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'\"  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937,  173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v.  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L.  Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). In reviewing a motion to dismiss,  the Court \"accept[s] the complaint's factual allegations  as true and draw[s] all reasonable inferences in the  plaintiff's favor.\" Brown Media Corp. v. K&L Gates, LLP,  854 F.3d 150, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2017). The Court begins by discussing three threshold issues  that could, potentially, bar multiple claims asserted by  two of the plaintiffs. It then discusses each surviving  claim that defendants seek to dismiss. A. Threshold Issues [*15]  1. Release by Settlement Agreement On April 28, 2022, DB Jane Doe resolved her claims  against Jeffrey Epstein's estate by signing a settlement  agreement (the \"Settlement Agreement\"). Deutsche  Bank was not a party to this agreement. Nonetheless,  Deutsche Bank argues that it is a third-party beneficiary  of that agreement, and that, as such, it is entitled under  the terms of that agreement to dismissal of the instant  claims. The first issue raised by Deutsche Bank's argument is  whether the Court may even entertain it at this juncture.  HN2[ ] Asserting that a plaintiff's claim is barred by  agreement is an affirmative defense, and affirmative  defenses usually cannot be considered on a motion to  dismiss. See, e.g., Deckard v. Gen. Motors Corp., 307  F.3d 556, 560 (7th Cir. 2002) (\"A motion to dismiss was  improper since release is an affirmative defense, and  the existence of a defense does not undercut the  adequacy of the claim.\"). Nonetheless, this bar is not  absolute. For example, the Court may consider any  affirmative defense that \"appears on the face of the  complaint.\" Pani v. Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, 152  F.3d 67, 74 (2d Cir. 1998). More generally, the Court  retains discretion to consider even at this early stage an  affirmative defense that presents a straightforward issue  of law, such as a statute of limitations defense [*16]   where the relevant facts are not in dispute. See, e.g.,  Harris v. City of New York, 186 F.3d 243, 250 (2d Cir.  1999). While the Settlement Agreement is not mentioned in DB  Jane Doe's complaint, the Court finds nonetheless that  Deutsche Bank's argument is appropriately considered  at this stage. The authenticity of the Settlement  Agreement is not disputed, and neither party has  suggested that extrinsic evidence would inform the  Court's interpretation of it. Thus, Deutsche Bank's  argument presents an unfettered question of law that  can be resolved on a motion to dismiss and should not  be deferred. See Giuffre v. Andrew, 579 F. Supp. 3d  429, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2022) (considering a similar  settlement agreement on a motion to dismiss). Turning now to the merits of Deutsche Bank's argument,  the Court first notes that this argument succeeds only if  the parties to the Settlement Agreement intended for  Deutsche Bank to benefit from it. See Port Chester Elec.  Const. Co. v. Atlas, 40 N.Y.2d 652, 357 N.E.2d 983,  985-86, 389 N.Y.S.2d 327 (N.Y. 1976) (HN3[ ] \"It is old  law that a third party may sue as a beneficiary on a  contract made for his benefit. However, an intent to  benefit the third party must be shown . . . .\"); Suffolk  Cnty. v. Long Island Lighting Co., 728 F.2d 52, 63 (2d  Cir. 1984) (\"It is ancient law in New York that to succeed  on a third party beneficiary theory, a non-party must be  the intended beneficiary of the contract, not an  incidental beneficiary to whom no duty is owed.\"); see  also [*17]  Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 302. In  general, such an intent can be found only when \"the  language of the contract . . . clearly evidences an intent  to permit enforcement by the third party.\" Fourth Ocean  Putnam Corp. v. Interstate Wrecking Co., 66 N.Y.2d 38,  485 N.E.2d 208, 212, 495 N.Y.S.2d 1 (N.Y. 1985). Deutsche Bank claims that the Settlement Agreement  evidences such an intent because it is styled a \"broad  release\" of claims against \"any entities or individuals  who are or have ever been engaged by (whether as  independent contractors or otherwise), employed by, or  worked in any capacity for\" Jeffrey Epstein. See  Declaration of David B. Hennes in Supp. of Mot. to  Dismiss, Ex. A (\"Settlement Agreement\"), at p. 2. Since,  Deutsche Bank argues, DB Jane Doe's own theory of  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *14 Page 12 of 23 her case is that Deutsche Bank was both \"engaged by\"  and in some sense \"worked . . . for\" Epstein, Deutsche  Bank is covered by the Settlement Agreement. But the terms \"engaged by\" and \"worked . . . for\" must  be read in the context of the agreement as a whole. And  another provision of the Settlement Agreement plainly  indicates that it was not intended to preclude claims  against financial institutions that provided services to  Epstein. Specifically, the Settlement Agreement states,  \"[T]he parties do not believe there is any reasonable  interpretation that this General [*18]  Release could be  construed to release James (\"Jes\") Staley, Leon Black,  or their respective entity affiliations.\" Settlement  Agreement, at p. 4 (emphasis supplied). Jes Staley was  employed by JP Morgan, which provided financial  services to Jeffrey Epstein. In effect, this demonstrates  the parties' agreement that the Settlement Agreement  was never intended to release claims against financial  institutions that provided services for Epstein and,  indeed, could not even be reasonably interpreted as  such. Read as a whole, therefore, the Settlement Agreement  does not \"clearly evidence\" an intent to benefit  Deutsche Bank. Thus, the Court finds that Deutsche  Bank is not a third-party beneficiary of that agreement,  and DB Jane Doe's claims are not barred by it. 2. Parens Patriae Standing                       The next two threshold issues concern whether the  USVI can assert claims under the TVPA. The first such  issue is whether the USVI has standing to assert such  claims. The USVI asserts that it has standing as parens patriae.  There can be no doubt that Congress intended to grant  it such standing. One section of the Trafficking Victims  Protection Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1595(d), reads: In any case in which the attorney general of a State  has reason to believe that [*19]  an interest of the  residents of that State has been or is threatened or  adversely affected by any person who violates  section 1591, the attorney general of the State, as  parens patriae, may bring a civil action against such  person on behalf of the residents of the State in an  appropriate district court of the United States to  obtain appropriate relief. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(d). Congress, however, does not have final word. HN4[ ]  Article III of the Constitution has been interpreted to  impose distinct requirements for standing to sue in  federal  court,  and  those  requirements  are  not  \"automatically\" satisfied \"whenever a statute grants a  person a statutory right and purports to authorize that  person to sue to vindicate that right.\" Spokeo, Inc. v.  Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 341, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 194 L. Ed.  2d 635 (2016), as revised (May 24, 2016). To establish  Article III standing, any plaintiff must show (i) that he  suffered an injury in fact that is concrete, particularized,  and actual or imminent; (ii) that the injury was likely  caused by the defendant; and (iii) that the injury would  likely be redressed by judicial relief. TransUnion LLC v.  Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2203, 210 L. Ed. 2d 568  (2021). States and territories that seek to sue parens  patriae must also (1) allege an injury to a quasi- sovereign interest that affects a sufficiently substantial  segment of its population and (2) seek relief to the  territory's injury that [*20]  would be unavailable to  individual plaintiffs. See Alfred L. Snapp & Son Inc. v.  P.R. ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 607, 102 S. Ct. 3260,  73 L. Ed. 2d 995 (1982). Nonetheless, even though  Congress's creation of a statutory right of action does  not settle whether these requirements are satisfied, it is  \"instructive.\" Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 341. \"Congress may  elevate harms that exist in the real world before  Congress recognized them to actionable legal status.\"  Id. (cleaned up).   2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *17 Page 13 of 23 JP Morgan challenges the USVI's parens patriae  standing. It argues, first, that to the extent that the USVI  sues on behalf of Epstein's victims who resided in the  USVI, that interest is not \"distinct from the interests of  particular private parties\" and therefore cannot be a  basis for parens patriae standing. Def's Mem. of Law in  Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, at 6. But, second, to the extent  that the USVI seeks to vindicate a more generalized  interest -- such as an interest in \"assuring its residents it  will act to protect them from the harmful effects of  criminal sex-trafficking enterprises flourishing in the  Islands that are their home,\" Mem. of Law. in Opp. to  Def's Mot. to Dismiss, at pp. 9-10 -- this interest, JP  Morgan  says,  is  insufficiently  concrete  and  particularized. However, JP Morgan overstates the second objection.  The USVI's asserted [*21]  interest in \"assuring its  residents it will act to protect them from the harmful  effects of criminal sex-trafficking enterprises flourishing  in the Islands that are their home\" is indeed general (as  all interests that ground parens patriae standing must  be); but it directly parallels the interest that Puerto Rico  successfully asserted in Snapp, which was an interest in  \"assuring its residents that it will act to protect them from  . . . the harmful effects of discrimination.\" Snapp, 458  U.S. at 609. Indeed, the similarities between the interest asserted by  the USVI here and that asserted by Puerto Rico in  Snapp are considerable. Like the discrimination that  was at stake in Snapp, sex-trafficking is a problem that  might well re-occur, especially in a remote an isolated  territory such as the USVI. Additionally, sex-trafficking is  a problem that the USVI would, if it could, \"likely attempt  to address through its sovereign lawmaking powers.\"  Snapp, 458 U.S. at 607. Snapp remains a leading case -- perhaps the leading  case --on parens patriae standing. Since the interest  asserted by the USVI here is directly analogous to the  interest that provided parens patriae standing in Snapp,  the USVI has Article III standing. 3. Retroactivity of [*22]  18 U.S.C. § 1595(d) The last threshold issue, which similarly affects whether  the USVI can assert a TVPA claim, is whether the  applicable statutory provision, 18 U.S.C. § 1595(d)  applies retroactively. While the statute providing a  federal civil remedy for victims of sex trafficking, 18  U.S.C. § 1595, was mostly enacted in 2003, the \"parens  patriae\" subdivision, section 1595(d), was not added  until 2018, approximately five years after JP Morgan  terminated its relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. JP  Morgan argues that Section 1595(d) does not apply  retroactively and, therefore, does not provide the USVI  with a right to assert the parens patriae TVPA claim  alleged in the USVI's complaint. HN5[ ] As a general matter, federal courts apply a two- prong test to determine whether statutes apply  retroactively. Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244,  280, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1994); Velez v.  Sanchez, 693 F.3d 308, 324-25 (2d Cir. 2012). The first  step is to ask \"whether Congress has expressly  prescribed the statute's proper reach.\" Landgraf, 511  U.S. at 280; Velez, 693 F.3d at 325. If Congress is  silent, a court must ask \"whether [the statute] would  impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase  a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties  with respect to transactions already completed.\"  Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280; Velez, 693 F.3d at 325. Since Congress did not expressly indicate whether  section 1595(d) applies retroactively, the precise issue  before the Court is whether section 1595(d) increased  parties' liabilities [*23]  for past conduct to such an  extent that it does not apply retroactively. To address  that question, the Court must consider whether section  1595(d) so greatly increased the likelihood that  defendants would face suit that it is equivalent to a new  cause of action. HN6[ ] Section 1595(d) does not, in  itself, impose any legal liability; it merely allows a new  group of people -- state attorneys general -- to vindicate  liabilities that already existed. Cf. Hughes Aircraft Co. v.  U.S. ex rel. Schumer, 520 U.S. 939, 950, 117 S. Ct.  1871, 138 L. Ed. 2d 135 (1997), (distinguishing a statute  that \"essentially creates a new cause of action\" from  one that creates \"an increased likelihood that an existing  cause of action will be pursued\"). Nonetheless, by  conferring a right of action on \"an expanded universe of  plaintiffs with different incentives,\" id. at 950, a statute  can so greatly increase the likelihood of suit that it is  functionally equivalent to a new cause of action.  Determining whether a statute does this demands \"a  commonsense, functional judgment about whether the  new provision attaches new legal consequences to  events completed before its enactment.\" I.N.S. v. St.  Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 321, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d  347 (2001) (cleaned up). The Court's judgment should  be guided by \"familiar considerations of fair notice,  reasonable reliance, and settled expectations.\" Martin v.  Hadix, 527 U.S. 343, 345, 119 S. Ct. 1998, 144 L. Ed.  2d 347 (1999). Applying this standard, the Court finds [*24]  that  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *20 Page 14 of 23 section 1595(d) applies retroactively. State attorneys  general do indeed have somewhat different incentives  to bring suit than private citizens; presumably, that is  one reason why Congress added section 1595(d). So  there likely will be some cases in which a state attorney  general files a civil action under the TVPA even though  individual victims of human trafficking would not. HN7[ ] But section 1595(d) only authorizes state  attorneys general to vindicate the interests of their  individual residents, acting as parens patriae. This limits  the incremental exposure of defendants in two ways.  First, section 1595(d) confers a right of action on only a  small number of new plaintiffs in each case: the  attorneys general of each state whose residents have  been harmed by a particular sex trafficking venture.  Second, and more important, the quasi-sovereign  interests that give states standing to sue under section  1595(d) are tied to injuries that would give individual  plaintiffs a right to sue under section 1595(a). For both  of these reasons, section 1595(d) increases the  likelihood of suit to a relatively small degree. A comparison to the facts of Hughes is instructive.  Hughes considered the inverse of the facts presented  here. Prior to a 1986 amendment, the False Claims Act  did not permit private relators to sue on behalf of  the [*25]  Government when their suits were based on  information already in the Government's possession. Id.  at 941. (The Government, by contrast, could sue on its  own behalf.) A 1986 amendment eliminated that  precondition for private parties to sue. Thus, the 1986  amendment to the False Claims Act enabled countless  private parties to sue under circumstances in which,  previously, only the Government could sue. The  statutory amendment considered in Hughes, therefore,  expanded the likelihood of suit dramatically. The Second Circuit's decision in Velez is not to the  contrary. In Velez, the Second Circuit rejected a  plaintiff's claim that the TVPA's private right of action --  18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) -- applies retroactively. Applying  this right of action retroactively, the Second Circuit held,  would \"represent[] a significant expansion of civil  liability.\" Velez, 693 F.3d at 325; see also Hughes, 520  U.S. at 939 (\"The extension of an FCA cause of action  to private parties in circumstances where the action was  previously foreclosed . . . essentially creates a new  cause of action . . . .\"); Doe v. Siddig, 810 F.Supp.2d  127, 135 (D.D.C.2011) (rejecting the retroactive  applicability of 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) because it  \"represented a significant expansion of civil liability\"). But there is a crucial difference between Velez and the  USVI's claim against JP Morgan. Before Congress  established [*26]  a private right of action under the  TVPA, the TVPA was a purely criminal statute. Thus,  when Congress added a private right of action to the  TVPA in 2003, it added civil liability to a statute that  previously only imposed criminal sanctions. That act did  indeed \"represent a significant expansion of civil  liability.\" Velez, 693 F.3d at 325. By contrast, in 2018,  when Congress empowered state attorneys general to  assert TVPA claims, it merely gave a new set of  plaintiffs the right to vindicate potential liabilities which  already existed. Put another way, 18 U.S.C § 1595(d)  did not expand any party's liability; it merely made it  more likely that such liability would actually be  assessed. Cf. Hughes, 520 U.S. at 950 (distinguishing a  statute that \"essentially creates a new cause of action\"  from one that creates \"an increased likelihood that an  existing cause of action will be pursued\"). Velez,  therefore, does not control. B. TVPA Participation Liability Having disposed of these threshold issues, the Court  now turns to the plaintiffs' individual claims. Each  plaintiff claims that JP Morgan or Deutsche Bank  participated in Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking venture,  in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2). This claim  involves three elements. HN8[ ] First, the defendant  must have participated [*27]  in a commercial sex  trafficking venture. Second, the defendant must have  known (or recklessly disregarded) that force, fraud, or  coercion would be used in the sex-trafficking venture.  Finally, the defendant must have benefited from its  participation in the venture. 1. Participation JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank argue that they did not  participate in Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking venture  because they merely provided their usual banking  services to him and his affiliated entities. That, they  contend, is not enough to \"participate\" in the venture  under the TVPA. HN9[ ] Participation requires \"specific  conduct that furthered the sex trafficking venture,\" Noble  v. Weinstein, 335 F. Supp. 3d 504, 524 (S.D.N.Y. 2018)  -- \"more than just passive facilitation, but some level of  active engagement.\" G.G. v. Salesforce.com, 603 F.  Supp. 3d 626, 644 (N.D. Ill. 2022). Simply providing  their usual services, defendants say, does not rise to the  level of such active engagement. See Geiss v.  Weinstein Co. Holdings LLC, 383 F. Supp. 3d 156, 169  (S.D.N.Y. 2019); Salesforce.com, 603 F. Supp. 3d at  648. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *24 Page 15 of 23 But even if participation requires such engagement,  plaintiffs  adequately  allege  that  defendants  so  participated in Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking venture.  JPM Jane Doe and the USVI allege, inter alia, that JP  Morgan assisted with \"structuring\" cash withdrawals so  that those withdrawals would not appear suspicious.  JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 179, 189. [*28]  They allege  that JP Morgan delayed filing suspicious activity reports  concerning Epstein's activities. Id. at ¶¶ 180-81; USVI  FAC, ¶¶ 74-75. And they allege that JP Morgan actually  trafficked women and girls for Jeffrey Epstein through its  subsidiary, Highbridge. JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 170,  176. Similarly, DB Jane Doe alleges that Deutsche Bank  \"concealed its delivery of hundreds of thousands of  dollars in cash to Epstein and his associates\" by willfully  failing to file suspicious activity reports, DB Jane Doe  FAC, ¶ 324; that DB \"structured\" 97 cash withdrawals by  Epstein's co-conspirators in the amount of $7,500 per  withdrawal to avoid alerting authorities, id. at ¶ 337; that  Deutsche Bank failed to implement oversight imposed  by its Americas Reputational Risk Committee, id. at ¶  325; and that Deutsche Bank allowed Epstein to use its  accounts \"to send dozens of wires, directly and  indirectly, including at least 18 wires in the amount of  $10,000 or more to then known co-conspirators.\" Id. at  ¶¶ 212-13. Moreover, even the cash that DB provided to  Epstein, DB Jane Doe alleges, was unusual. Id. at ¶ 320  (\"It was far from routine for Deutsche Bank to provide  $200,000 per year in cash to [*29]  someone like  Epstein, who did not have an apparent need for such  extravagant sums. Moreover, the circumstances in  which Epstein was requesting such large amounts were  far from routine and raised numerous 'red flags'—taking  it well outside routine circumstances.\"). In short, plaintiffs allege that both JP Morgan and  Deutsche Bank went well beyond merely providing their  usual services to Jeffrey Epstein and his affiliated  entities. Thus, even if it is true that \"active participation\"  in a sex-trafficking venture requires some special  tailoring of one's services to that venture, plaintiffs  plausibly plead that this element of participation liability  is satisfied. 2. Knowledge HN10[ ] The second element of participation liability  under the TVPA is knowledge. The defendant must  either have known, or recklessly disregarded the fact  that, \"force, fraud, or coercion\" was used to \"cause [a]  person to engage in a commercial sex act.\" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a)(2). To satisfy this element, it not enough for  the defendant to have \"only an abstract awareness of  sex trafficking in general.\" S.J. v. Choice Hotels Int'l,  Inc., 473 F. Supp. 3d 147, 154 (E.D.N.Y. 2020). Instead,  the defendant must have known, or recklessly  disregarded, that force, fraud, or coercion was used in  the particular sex-trafficking venture [*30]  that it is  alleged to have participated in. Id. Defendants argue that even more specific knowledge is  necessary. They say that they can be held liable only if  they knew that force, fraud, or coercion was used with  respect to the plaintiff herself. It is true that some courts  appear to have taken this position in the past. See, e.g.,  Salesforce.com, 603 F. Supp. 3d at 646 (\"[A] claim  under [Section] 1595 requires that 'the defendant must  have either actual or constructive knowledge that the  venture—in which it voluntarily participated and from  which it knowingly benefited—violated [Section 1591] as  to the plaintiff.\"); Lundstrom v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc.,  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 228651, 2021 WL 5579117, at *8  (D. Colo. Nov. 30, 2021) (failure to allege defendant  \"should have known about plaintiff's sex trafficking at its  hotels\"); A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc., 484 F.  Supp. 3d 921, 938-39 (D. Or. 2020) (failure to \"allege[]  facts which sufficiently link notice of Plaintiff['s] sex  trafficking to any of these Defendants\"). But those  decisions do not control this Court, and defendants do  not cite to any element of either the text or the  legislative history of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2) that  supports this interpretation. Instead, the text of section 1591(a)(2) directly supports  the plaintiffs' interpretation of the knowledge element of  their TVPA claims. HN11[ ] Section 1591(a)(2)  imposes  liability  for  knowingly  benefiting  from  \"participating in\" a sex-trafficking venture. A sex- trafficking venture, [*31]  in turn, is defined as a venture  that has \"recruit[ed], entic[ed], harbor[ed], transport[ed],  provid[ed],  obtain[ed],  advertise[d],  maintain[ed],  patronize[ed], or solicit[ed] by any means a person\" that  uses \"force, threats of force, fraud, coercion . . . or any  combination of such means\" to \"cause the person to  engage in a commercial sex act.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a).  By the express terms of the statute, then, liability is  imposed for knowingly benefiting from participation in a  sex-trafficking venture, not for knowingly benefiting from  the sex-trafficking of a particular person. Knowledge,  therefore, is required with respect to the venture, not    2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *27 Page 16 of 23 with respect to any particular person. Plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts to support their  allegations that JP Morgan had such knowledge of  Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking venture, either directly  or by recklessly disregarding what was plainly to be  seen. As detailed above, plaintiffs allege that JP Morgan  was aware of Epstein's convictions for sex crimes and  ignored numerous red flags associated with Epstein's  accounts, which all suggested that Jeffrey Epstein  operated  a  sex-trafficking  venture.  Even  these  allegations  alone  are  sufficient  to  support  plaintiffs' [*32]  allegations that JP Morgan knew or  recklessly disregarded that Epstein operated such a  venture. But there is more, such as Jes Staley's alleged personal  knowledge of Epstein's sex-trafficking venture. HN12[ ]  \"[W]hen an agent is employed to perform certain duties  for his principal and acquires knowledge material to  those duties, the agent's knowledge is imputed to the  principal.\" Apollo Fuel Oil v. United States, 195 F.3d 74,  76 (2d Cir. 1999). When Epstein was JP Morgan's  client, Mr. Staley was one of JP Morgan's high-level  executives, and his duties included overseeing Epstein's  account. USVI FAC, ¶ 84. And if the allegations in  plaintiffs' complaints are taken as true, Mr. Staley had  actual first-hand knowledge that Epstein conducted a  sex-trafficking venture. In fact, JPM Jane Doe alleges  that Mr. Staley observed her specifically \"as a sexual  trafficking and abuse victim.\" FAC, ¶ 115. Through  attribution of Mr. Staley's alleged knowledge to JP  Morgan, the complaints might well support an allegation  that JP Morgan actually knew that Jeffrey Epstein ran a  sex-trafficking venture. At the very least, they sufficiently  support plaintiffs' allegation that JP Morgan recklessly  disregarded the existence of such a venture. DB Jane Doe also pleads sufficient facts [*33]  to  support her allegation that Deutsche Bank knew or  recklessly disregarded that Jeffrey Epstein ran a sex- trafficking venture. Before Epstein was onboarded at  Deutsche Bank, DB Jane Doe alleges, Epstein was  convicted of soliciting a minor for prostitution. DB Jane  Doe FAC, ¶¶ 42-43, 279. Then, in November 2012, Paul  Morris joined Deutsche Bank from JP Morgan, where he        had been a member of the team that serviced Epstein's  account, he and brought to DB his knowledge of  Epstein's affairs. Id. at ¶ 201. Thereafter, beginning  around November 2013, Epstein began using Deutsche  Bank accounts to send wire transfers to collaborators in  his sex-trafficking operation, whose names and alleged  collaborative activity had by then been made public. Id.  at ¶¶ 212-16. Not much after that, in 2014 and 2015, an  internal department within Deutsche Bank alerted  management about Epstein's sex trafficking. Id. at ¶  231. And a Deutsche Bank executive is alleged to have  met with Epstein and to have observed victims in  Epstein's home. Id. at ¶¶ 235-36. If taken as true, and  viewed in a light most favorably to DB Jane Doe, these  allegations make it plausible that Deutsche Bank knew  of, or recklessly disregarded, [*34]  Jeffrey Epstein's  sex-trafficking venture. Thus, the Court finds that the plaintiffs have pled  sufficient facts to support their allegations that JP  Morgan and Deutsche Bank knew or recklessly  disregarded that Jeffrey Epstein conducted a sex- trafficking venture. 3. Benefit HN13[ ] The last element of liability for participating in  a sex-trafficking venture is that the defendant benefited  from its participation. JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank do  not contest that they received fees and other revenue  from providing services to Jeffrey Epstein and his  affiliated entities. But they both assert that the mere  receipt of revenue does not satisfy the benefit  requirement. Instead, they say, plaintiffs must allege  that they received revenue from Jeffrey Epstein and his  affiliated entities in exchange for their furtherance of  Epstein's sex-trafficking venture. See Geiss v. Weinstein  Co. Holdings LLC, 383 F. Supp. 3d 156, 169 (S.D.N.Y.  2019) (\"[T]here must be a causal relationship between  affirmative conduct furthering the sex-trafficking venture  and receipt of a benefit.\"). Although the Court is not convinced that the benefit  element should be read in this way, even assuming  arguendo that defendants are correct, the plaintiffs have  here offered sufficient allegations to satisfy this [*35]   element. Indeed, JPM Jane Doe expressly alleges that  JP Morgan chose to ignore warnings that Epstein was  involved  in  sex-trafficking  because  JP  Morgan  understood that it would lose a lot of money if it fired  Epstein as client. JPM Jane Doe FAC ¶¶ 152, 173, 214.  JPM Jane Doe also alleges that JP Morgan executives  specifically lobbied to keep Epstein as a client despite  reports of sex-trafficking JP Morgan's relationship with  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *31 Page 17 of 23 Epstein was lucrative. Id. at ¶¶ 132-33, 161, 172, 184,  213-14. DB Jane Doe makes similar allegations against  Deutsche Bank. DB Jane Doe alleges that Deutsche  Bank overlooked warnings that Epstein was involved in  sex-trafficking because of the \"number of sizable deals\"  that DB obtained through its relationship with Jeffrey  Epstein. DB Jane Doe FAC, ¶ 243. DB Jane Doe also  alleges that Paul Morris proposed that DB establish  accounts for entities affiliated with Jeffrey Epstein, not  personal accounts in Epstein's name, to help conceal  both DB's participation in Epstein's sex-trafficking  venture and the existence of that venture. Id. at ¶¶ 205,  243. Like plaintiffs' allegations against JP Morgan, these  allegations make it plausible that Deutsche Bank  knowingly  benefited [*36]   from  furthering  Jeffrey  Epstein's sex-trafficking venture. 4. Conclusion In short, the allegations in the complaints, if taken as  true and viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs,  plausibly support each element of plaintiffs' claims under  18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2). Accordingly, defendants'  motions to dismiss these claims are denied. C. Liability for Obstructing TVPA Enforcement JPM Jane Doe and DB Jane Doe also allege that JP  Morgan and Deutsche Bank obstructed the enforcement  of the TVPA. HN14[ ] 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) makes it  unlawful to \"obstruct[], attempt[] to obstruct, or in any  way interfere[] with or prevent[] the enforcement of\" 18  U.S.C. § 1591(d). For a defendant to be liable for  obstructing the enforcement of the TVPA, it must (1)  know of an effort to enforce the TVPA and (2)  intentionally obstruct or attempt to obstruct that  enforcement effort. See United States v. Farah, 766  F.3d 599, 612 (6th Cir. 2014). Plaintiffs allege that JP  Morgan and Deutsche Bank obstructed the enforcement  of the TVPA by, among other things, failing to file  suspicious activity reports that would have alerted  authorities to Epstein's sex-trafficking venture. JPM  Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 476-79; DB Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 449- 52. As an initial matter, defendants argue that JPM Jane  Doe and DB Jane Doe have no right to assert  obstruction [*37]  claims. HN15[ ] The TVPA's \"civil  remedy,\" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a), only provides a right of  action to a \"victim\" of a violation of the TVPA. 18 U.S.C.  § 1595(a). And defendants argue that JPM Jane Doe  and DB Jane Doe are not the victims of any obstruction  of an enforcement effort. The only victim of such an  action, defendants say, is the government that makes  such an effort. See Doe v. Fitzgerald, 2022 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 8194, 2022 WL 425016, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 6,  2022) (\"The 'victim' of the obstruction of enforcement set  out in section 1591(d) is the state or federal  government[.]\"). Thus, defendants say, the Jane Does  do not have a right to assert their obstruction claims. The statute cannot be read in this cramped fashion.  HN16[ ] While 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) does not define  \"victim,\" a different section of the federal criminal code --  which establishes criminal procedure that is generally  applicable across federal crimes -- defines a \"crime  victim\" as \"a person directly and proximately harmed as  a result of the commission of a Federal offense.\" 18  U.S.C. § 3771(e)(2)(A); see also 34 U.S.C. §  20141(e)(2) (defining a victim as \"a person that has  suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm  as a result of the commission of a crime\"). This  definition accords with ordinary usage, which recognizes  as a victim \"one that is injured, destroyed, or sacrificed  under any of various conditions.\" Victim, Merriam- Webster's [*38]  Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed.). Thus,  the \"victims\" of one who obstructs the enforcement of  the TVPA include not just the government, but also  include  those  who  suffered  harm  because  the  government's enforcement efforts were hindered. Turning now to the merits of plaintiffs' claims, the Court  finds that the plaintiffs plead sufficient facts to support  their obstruction claims. JPM Jane Doe and DB Jane  Doe allege that JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank,  respectively,  knew  of  investigations  into  Jeffrey  Epstein's  sex-trafficking  operation  and  that  they  intentionally failed to file suspicious activity reports in  order to frustrate such investigations. JPM Jane Doe  FAC, ¶¶ 187, 224, 296, 356, 368, 397, 432, 438-40; DB  Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 42-46, 60-63, 188-99, 212-13, 445- 48. Thus, the Court denies defendants' motions to  dismiss plaintiffs' obstruction claims. D. TVPA Perpetrator Liability Plaintiffs'  allegations  that  defendants  themselves  perpetrated sex-trafficking are another matter. HN17[ ]  A direct perpetrator of sex trafficking is someone who  knowingly  \"recruits,  entices,  harbors,  transports,  provides, obtains, advertises, maintains, patronizes, or  solicits\"  an  underage  person  to  engage  in  a  commercial [*39]  sex act or does the same to an adult  by means of force, fraud, or coercion. 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a)(1). Plaintiffs' allegations do not adequately  allege that either JP Morgan or Deutsche Bank did so. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *35 Page 18 of 23 DB Jane Doe claims that Deutsche Bank's cash \"was  part of the 'recruitment' of Jane Doe and other victims.\"  Pl.'s Mem. in Oppo. to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss, at 21. The  alleged facts that Epstein used cash obtained from  Deutsche Bank to recruit his victims, and that Deutsche  Bank recklessly disregarded that he was so doing, might  jointly render Deutsche Bank liable for participating in  Epstein's venture (see above). But they do not make  Deutsche Bank the recruiter. JPM Jane Doe's allegations are a little more on point,  but still not sufficient. JPM Jane Doe alleges that JP  Morgan directly perpetrated sex-trafficking in two ways.  First, she alleges that \"a powerful financial executive\" at  JP Morgan (later identified as Jes Staley) sexually  assaulted JPM Jane Doe. Second, JPM Jane Doe  alleges that JP Morgan's subsidiary, Highbridge,  transported some of the victims of Jeffrey Epstein's sex- trafficking venture. But even if Mr. Staley's actions are  attributable to JP Morgan, those actions do not support  a perpetrator claim, [*40]  because the TVPA does not  impose liability for sexual assault per se (a classic state  crime), but also requires the additional elements  described above. See 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1). And JPM  Jane Doe's complaint does not allege that JP Morgan  knew that the women and girls allegedly transported by  Highbridge would be caused to engage in a commercial  sex act, which is likewise an essential element of a  TVPA perpetrator claim. See 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Since plaintiffs' allegations do not state all the elements  of claims for perpetrating a violation of the TVPA,  defendants' motions to dismiss these claims are  granted. E. Aiding and Abetting a Violation of the TVPA JPM Jane Doe and DB Jane Doe also allege that JP  Morgan and Deutsche Bank, even if they were not  themselves perpetrators, aided and abetted Jeffrey  Epstein's violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). They  support this claim with the following train of logic. First,  Jeffrey Epstein violated 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) through his  direct acts of sex-trafficking. Second, 18 U.S.C. § 2  makes anyone criminally \"punishable as a principal\" if  they aid or abet the commission of an offense against  the United States. Finally, 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) provides  a \"civil remedy\" to victims of the TVPA. It states: \"An  individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter [*41]  may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator (or whoever knowingly benefits, financially  or by receiving anything of value from participation in a  venture which that person knew or should have known  has engaged in an act in violation of this chapter) in an  appropriate  district  court  of  the  United  States\"  (emphasis supplied). In other words, plaintiffs contend  that 18 U.S.C. § 2 (a criminal statute) is incorporated  within the civil remedy provision of the TVPA. Since  principals are subject to civil liability when they violate  18 U.S.C. § 1591(a), and 18 U.S.C. § 2 puts aiders and  abettors in an equivalent criminal position to principals,  plaintiffs contend that aiders and abettors are subject to  civil liability under 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Plaintiffs' claims thus hinge on a question of law:  whether the \"civil remedy\" provided by 18 U.S.C. §  1595(a) enables sex-trafficking victims to pursue claims  for aiding and abetting. The parties take opposing  positions. Defendants argue that section 1595(a)'s civil  remedy does not apply, because aiding and abetting  liability is provided by 18 U.S.C. § 2, which is not within  \"this chapter\" (i.e., the TVPA: 18 U.S.C. § 1581 et seq.).  See Noble, 335 F. Supp. 3d at 525-526 (rejecting aiding  and abetting liability under the TVPA). Plaintiffs,  meanwhile, contend that 18 U.S.C. § 2 is incorporated  within the TVPA. HN18[ ] The defendants [*42]  are correct: The TVPA  does not provide civil liability for aiding and abetting. In  general, aiding and abetting liability should not be  inferred when a statute does not expressly provide for it.  See Cent. Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank  of Denver, N.A., 511 U.S. 164, 185, 114 S. Ct. 1439,  128 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1994) (\"it is not plausible to interpret  the statutory silence as tantamount to an implicit  congressional intent to impose § 10(b) aiding and  abetting liability.\"). Moreover, neither the text nor the  legislative history of the TVPA indicates that Congress  intended to provide civil liability for aiding and abetting a  violation of it. In fact, some aspects of the TVPA's  legislative history suggests that Congress had the  opposite  intention:  Congress  specifically  rejected  defining \"participation in a venture\" -- which would entail  civil liability -- so as to include aiding and abetting.  Compare Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex  Trafficking Act of 2017, Pub. L. No. 115-164, § 5, 132  Stat. 1253, 1255 (2018) (rejecting definition of  \"participation in a venture\" that included \"aids or abets\")  with H.R. 1865, 115th Cong. (as introduced in House,  April 3, 2017) (bill draft proposing \"aids or abets\" in  definition of participation in a venture). A comparison to Rothstein v. UBS AG is instructive. See  Rothstein v. UBS AG, 708 F.3d 82 (2d Cir. 2013). In  Rothstein, the Second Circuit considered this issue as  presented by a similar statute, the Anti-Terrorism Act.  HN19[ ] The Anti-Terrorism Act, like the Trafficking  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *39 Page 19 of 23 Victims Protection Act [*43] , is a largely criminal statute  that also provides a civil remedy for violations of it. See  18 U.S.C. § 2333(a) (providing a private right of action).  Also like the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, the civil  remedy provision of the Anti-Terrorism Act does not  expressly provide liability for aiding or abetting, but the  Act is codified in Title 18 of the United States Code,  section 2 of which makes any aider or abettor  \"punishable as a principal.\" In Rothstein, the Second  Circuit held that 18 U.S.C. § 2333 does not provide a  right of action to assert claims for aiding and abetting.  Rothstein, 708 F.3d at 97-98. Rothstein's holding was supported by two premises. The  court noted Central Bank's general presumption that  aiding and abetting liability should not be inferred from  statutory silence. Id. at 97. And the court also noted that  other provisions of the ATA --sections that surround its  civil remedy provision -- do provide for aiding and  abetting liability. Id. at 98. That context, the court found,  suggested that Congress affirmatively rejected aiding  civil liability for aiding and abetting a violation of the  ATA. HN20[ ] So too for the TVPA. There is a presumption  that aiding and abetting liability should not be read into  section 1595's silence, a presumption that is confirmed  by its legislative history. Since, therefore, the TVPA  does not provide civil liability for aiding and abetting  under section 2, plaintiffs' aiding and abetting claims are  dismissed. F. Attempting to Benefit from a TVPA Violation Plaintiffs also allege that JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank  attempted to benefit from a TVPA violation. HN21[ ] A  defendant is liable for attempting to violate the law only  if they have the specific intent to commit the underlying  violation of the law. United States v. Farhane, 634 F.3d  127, 145 (2d Cir. 2011). But [*44]  the complaints here  do not plead facts that support the inference that either  JP Morgan or Deutsche Bank had this specific intention.  If taken as true, plaintiffs' allegations do support the  inference that Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan intended  to profit from their relationships with Jeffrey Epstein, and  that accomplishing that object required JP Morgan and  Deutsche Bank to provide banking services that  allegedly,  they  knew,  or  recklessly  disregarded,  supported Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking venture. But  the complaints do not support the allegation that either  JP Morgan or Deutsche Bank acted with the specific  intent of benefiting from a sex-trafficking venture. Thus,  plaintiffs' claims for attempting to violate the TPVA are  dismissed. G. Conspiracy to Violate the TVPA Finally, plaintiffs allege that JP Morgan and Deutsche  Bank conspired with Epstein and others to violate the  TVPA. HN22[ ] \"The gist of conspiracy is, of course,  agreement.\" United States v. Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp.,  871 F.2d 1181, 1191 (2d Cir. 1989). To be liable, each  defendant must have \"entered into a joint enterprise with  consciousness of its general nature and extent.\" United  States v. Alessi, 638 F.2d 466, 473 (2d Cir. 1980).  Plaintiffs' factual allegations do not support the inference  that either defendant made such an agreement. If the  allegations [*45]  in the complaints are taken as true,  the defendants did indeed agree to provide banking  services for Epstein and his affiliated entities and that  they knew, or recklessly disregarded, would assist his  sex-trafficking venture. But that agreement is different  from an actual agreement to participate in a sex- trafficking venture. Plaintiffs also allege that the  defendants covered up Epstein's sex-trafficking by  willfully failing to file suspicious activity reports. But  plaintiffs do not plead any facts which support the  inference that the defendants did so pursuant to an  agreement with Epstein and/or others to further his sex- trafficking operation. Thus, plaintiffs' conspiracy claims  are dismissed. H. RICO Having discussed plaintiffs' TVPA claims, the Court now  turns to DB Jane Doe's claim that Deutsche Bank  violated section 1962(c) of the Racketeering Influenced  and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. §§  1961 et seq., and conspired to violate RICO in violation  of section 1962(d). HN23[ ] There can no liability under section 1962(c) if  the defendant did not participate in the conduct of an  enterprise. See DeFalco v. Bernas, 244 F.3d 286, 306  (2d Cir. 2001) (to state a civil claim under 18 U.S.C.  1962(c), a plaintiff must allege that a defendant  participated in \"(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)  through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity\") (quoting  Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496, 105  S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1985)). To participate in a  racketeering  enterprise [*46]   under  the  relevant  provisions of RICO, a defendant must \"direct the  enterprise's affairs.\" Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S.  170, 177, 180, 113 S. Ct. 1163, 122 L. Ed. 2d 525  (1993). While a defendant need not play the  \"predominant\" part in the operation of the enterprise, it  must \"exert\" some \"control\" over it. Dubai Islamic Bank  v. Citibank, N.A., 256 F. Supp. 2d 158, 164 (S.D.N.Y.  2003). 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *42 Page 20 of 23 While DB Jane Doe does not precisely define the  enterprise that Deutsche Bank and Jeffrey Epstein  allegedly formed (and this itself would warrant dismissal  of her RICO claims) her allegation appears to be that  Deutsche Bank participated in Jeffrey Epstein's sex  trafficking venture. If that is Jane Doe's allegation, her  substantive civil RICO claim fails, for she has not  alleged that Deutsche Bank controlled or directed that  venture in any way. DB Jane Doe's RICO conspiracy claim likewise fails, for  she has not alleged any factual basis for a finding of a  \"conscious agreement among the defendants.\" Hecht v.  Commerce Clearing House, Inc., 897 F.2d 21, 26 n. 4  (2d Cir. 1990). DB Jane Doe has not pled sufficient facts  to  support  her  allegation  that  Deutsche  Bank  consciously agreed to undertake racketeering activity in  violation of section 1962 with Jeffrey Epstein. Instead, at  most, she alleges that Deutsche Bank acted unlawfully  as part of an implicit quid pro quo: Deutsche Bank would  conceal Epstein's sex-trafficking venture in exchange for  Epstein's [*47]  lucrative fees. Because DB Jane Doe fails to plausibly allege that  Deutsche Bank participated in a violation of section  1962(c), or that Deutsche Bank consciously agreed to  participate in one, Deutsche Bank's motion to dismiss  DB Jane Doe's civil RICO claims is granted. I. CICO The USVI makes a similar allegation against JP  Morgan, which fails for similar reasons. The USVI  claims that JP Morgan violated the Virgin Islands  Criminally Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act  (\"CICO\"), the Virgin Islands' territorial-law analogue to  RICO. But the USVI fails to plausibly allege two of the  initial elements of such a claim: that a criminal  enterprise existed, and that JP Morgan participated in it. The USVI alleges that JP Morgan's association with  Jeffrey Epstein was a de facto enterprise. HN24[ ] Any  enterprise formed in this way -- an \"association-in-fact  enterprise\" -- must have three features: a common  purpose, relationships among those associated with the  enterprise, and longevity to pursue the enterprise's  purpose. People v. McKenzie, 66 V.I. 3, 12 (Super. Ct.  2017). The USVI, however, has failed to support its allegation  that JP Morgan shared a common purpose with Jeffrey  Epstein. The USVI does not allege that JP Morgan  shared the purpose of trafficking or abusing [*48]   Epstein's victims. Rather, the USVI alleges that the  purpose of JP Morgan's association with Epstein was  simply to make money. If the USVI's allegations are  taken as true, achieving that purpose did require JP  Morgan to support Epstein's sex-trafficking venture. But  neither human trafficking nor its consequences were  part of JP Morgan's purpose; JP Morgan would have  been just as happy for Epstein's victims to escape, so  long as Epstein's fees continued to roll in. And even if JP Morgan did form an enterprise with  Jeffrey Epstein, the facts in the complaint do not support  the USVI's allegation that JP Morgan participated in it.  Like DB Jane Doe, the USVI does not allege that JP  Morgan conducted Epstein's sex-trafficking venture in  any way. For that reason, and because the USVI fails to  plausibly allege an enterprise as well, JP Morgan's  motion to dismiss the USVI's CICO claim is granted. J. CFDBPA The last statutory claim brought against the defendants  is the USVI's claim that JP Morgan violated the Virgin  Islands Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business  Practices Act (\"CFDBPA\"). The USVI alleges that JP  Morgan gained an unfair advantage over other, law- abiding banks by supporting Epstein's [*49]  sex- trafficking venture. USVI FAC, ¶¶ 130-36. In exchange  for JP Morgan's support, the USVI alleges, Epstein  provided JP Morgan with \"referrals of high-value  business opportunities.\" Id. at ¶ 135. The USVI's pleadings are threadbare. The USVI does  not say which banks, in particular, were denied the  \"high-value business opportunities\" that JP Morgan  allegedly obtained. It does not describe any connection  between those banks and the Virgin Islands. And it does  not say that these banks actually did comply with their  legal obligations with respect to similarly-situated  customers, which is an essential aspect of the USVI's  unfairness claim. Thus, the USVI's allegations fall well  short of making its CFBDPA claim plausible, and JP  Morgan's motion to dismiss this claim is granted. K. Negligence JPM Jane Doe and DB Jane Doe and also assert  several New York state-law tort claims against JP  Morgan and Deutsche Bank. Their first set of such  claims allege that JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank were  negligent. They allege that the banks failed to exercise  reasonable care to prevent physical harm and that the  banks failed to exercise reasonable care as banking  institutions  providing  non-routine  banking  services. [*50]  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *46 Page 21 of 23 HN25[ ] Under New York law (as under the law of  virtually every state), there are three elements of  negligence: \"(1) a duty owed by the defendant to the  plaintiff, (2) a breach thereof, and (3) injury proximately  resulting therefrom.\" Solomon ex rel. Solomon v. City of  New York, 66 N.Y.2d 1026, 489 N.E.2d 1294, 499  N.Y.S.2d 392 (N.Y. 1985). The parties contest the first  and the third elements, duty and proximate causation. JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank say that they owed no  duty to Jane Doe. According the banks, they had no  duty to prevent Jeffrey Epstein from harming either Jane  Doe, nor did they acquire any duty of care from their  banking relationship with Epstein. See In re Terrorist  Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 714 F.3d 118, 126 (2d Cir.  2013) (\"[B]anks and other financial institutions do not  owe non-customers a duty to protect them from the  intentional torts of their customers.\"). HN26[ ] But JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank, like  everyone else, owed both Jane Does the ordinary duty  of reasonable care. This duty can extend to actions  undertaken by third parties. Restatement (Third) of  Torts: Phys. & Emot. Harm § 19 (\"The conduct of a  defendant can lack reasonable care insofar as it  foreseeably combines with or permits the improper  conduct of the plaintiff or a third party.\"); Ford v. Grand  Union Co., 268 N.Y. 243, 197 N.E. 266, 268-69 (N.Y.  1935) (defendant owes a duty to avoid injury to others  \"by forces set in motion\" by the defendant). Banks are  not exempt from this duty. See Elmaliach v. Bank of  China Ltd., 110 A.D.3d 192, 206, 971 N.Y.S.2d 504  (N.Y. App. Div. 2013) (\"We do not find case law [*51]  to  support the argument that . . . a bank can never be held  liable to non-customers\"); id. at 206 (\"[A] tortfeasor's  compliance with relevant laws and regulations will not  insulate it from liability if it fails to act objectively  reasonably\"). And this duty applies when banks provide  nonroutine services. See id. at 207 (\"Although New York  does not generally recognize a duty on the part of banks  to non-customers, that does not mean that New York  policy would prohibit recovery under the alleged facts, if  proven.\"). Since JPM Jane Doe and DB Jane Doe do  indeed allege that JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank  helped \"set in motion\" Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking  venture -- by providing the cash that fueled it -- they  plausibly assert that JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank  owed a duty to them. JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank also contend that their  conduct is not a proximate cause of Jane Doe's injury.  HN27[ ] When an alleged injury is caused by an  intervening criminal act, such as sexual abuse, the  defendant's conduct is a proximate cause only when  that intervening act is \"a natural and foreseeable  consequence of a circumstance created by [the]  defendant.\" Hain v. Jamison, 28 N.Y.3d 524, 46  N.Y.S.3d 502, 68 N.E. 3d 1233, 1236-37 (N.Y. 2016).  \"[P]roximate cause will be found lacking where the  original negligent act [*52]  merely 'furnished the  occasion for' . . . 'an unrelated act to cause injuries not  ordinarily anticipated.'\" Id. at 1238. And the banks assert  (rehearsing arguments considered above) that they  neither knew nor should have known that their services  contributed to the abuse of the Jane Does. For the reasons already discussed above, however,  JPM Jane Doe and DB Jane Doe allege that JP Morgan  and Deutsche Bank should have known that their  banking services sustained Jeffrey Epstein's sex- trafficking venture. Indeed, they go further and  adequately allege that the defendants actually knew this  or at least recklessly disregarded what was plainly to be  seen. Such constructive knowledge plausibly makes  harm to plaintiffs and other victims of Epstein's sex- trafficking a \"natural and foreseeable\" consequence of  the actions of JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank. Thus, the Court finds that JPM Jane Doe and DB Jane  Doe plausibly allege both that JP Morgan and Deutsche  Bank owed a duty to them, and that the banks  proximately caused harm to them by breaching that  duty. Thus, the Court denies defendants' motions to  dismiss plaintiffs' negligence claims. L. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress JPM Jane Doe and DB Jane [*53]  Doe also allege that  JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank intentionally inflicted  emotional distress upon them. HN28[ ] The elements  of such a claim under here applicable New York law are:  \"(1) extreme and outrageous conduct; (2) the intent to  cause, or the disregard of a substantial likelihood of  causing, severe emotional distress; (3) causation; and  (4) severe emotional distress.\" Eskridge v. Diocese of  Brooklyn, 210 A.D.3d 1056, 1057, 180 N.Y.S.3d 179  (N.Y. App. Div. 2022). At the outset, the Court notes that this cause of action is  \"highly disfavored\" and \"almost never successful.\" Sesto  v. Slaine, 171 F. Supp. 3d 194, 201-02 (S.D.N.Y. 2016).  That is especially so when, as here, the plaintiff asserts  a negligence claim. HN29[ ] Since almost all conduct  that amounts to the intentional infliction of emotional  distress (\"IIED\") also constitutes negligence, IIED claims  are routinely dismissed for their redundancy with  negligence claims. See, e.g., Wolkstein v. Morgenstern,  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *50 Page 22 of 23 275 A.D.2d 635, 637, 713 N.Y.S.2d 171 (N.Y. App. Div.  1st Dep't. 2000) (\"Generally, a cause of action for  infliction of emotional distress is not allowed if  essentially duplicative of tort or contract causes of  action.\"); Samuel et al. v. Rockefeller Univ., 2022 N.Y.  Misc. LEXIS 4415, 2022 WL 2916784, at *2 (N.Y. Sup.  Ct. July 25, 2022) (dismissing IIED claim as duplicative  of negligence claim). So it is with the Jane Does' IIED  claims: if the conduct of JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank  was extreme and outrageous, and was intended to  cause (or was made with reckless disregard for) severe  emotional distress, [*54]  and in fact caused severe  emotional distress -- JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank  were thereby also liable for negligence. This alone is  likely sufficient grounds for dismissal. Additionally, the plaintiffs fail to allege that JP Morgan  and Deutsche Bank \"intentionally directed\" their conduct  at them. Martin v. Citibank, N.A., 762 F.2d 212, 220 (2d  Cir. 1985) (\"The conduct must also be intentionally  directed at the plaintiff . . . .\"). None of the plaintiffs'  allegations supports the inference that either JP Morgan  or Deutsche Bank directed their conduct at JPM Jane  Doe or DB Jane Doe specifically. Instead, they are  alleged to have financed Jeffrey Epstein, who then  harmed JPM Jane Doe, DB Jane Doe, and others.  While the plaintiffs' harm might have been a foreseeable  consequence of defendants' actions, the allegations in  the complaints do not support the inference that it was  specifically directed toward them. For both of these  reasons, plaintiffs' IIED claims are dismissed. M. Aiding and Abetting Battery Last, JPM Jane Doe and DB Jane Doe allege that JP  Morgan and Deutsche Bank aided and abetted the  battery of them. They claim that Jeffrey Epstein and his  associates sexually abused them --acts that amounted  to battery -- and that the defendants supported [*55]   those wrongs. HN30[ ] Under New York law, there are three  elements of aiding and abetting battery: \"(1) a wrongful  act producing an injury; (2) the defendant's awareness  of a role as a part of an overall illegal or tortious activity  at the time he provides the assistance; and (3) the  defendant's knowing and substantial assistance in the  principal violation.\" Scollo ex rel. Scollo v. Nunez, 16  Misc. 3d 1118(A), 847 N.Y.S.2d 899 (Sup. Ct. 2007),  aff'd, 60 A.D.3d 840, 874 N.Y.S.2d 380 (N.Y. App. Div.  2009). The defendants focus on this last element: whether they  provided \"knowing and substantial assistance\" to those  who battered the Jane Does. \"Knowledge,\" for these  purposes, is actual knowledge. Lerner v. Fleet Bank,  N.A., 459 F.3d 273, 292 (2d Cir. 2006); JP Morgan  Chase Bank v. Winnick, 406 F. Supp. 2d 247, 253 n.4  (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (\"[T]he weight of the case law, cited  above, defines knowledge in the context of an aiding  and abetting claim as actual knowledge.\"); Kolbeck v.  LIT Am., Inc., 939 F. Supp. 240, 246 (S.D.N.Y. 1996),  aff'd, 152 F.3d 918 (2d Cir. 1998) (\"New York common  law, which controls the analysis here, has not adopted a  constructive knowledge standard for imposing aiding  and abetting liability. Rather, New York courts and  federal courts in this district, have required actual  knowledge.\"); Steinberg v. Goldstein, 27 A.D.2d 955,  279 N.Y.S.2d 240, 242 (App. Div. 1967). \"Substantial  assistance,\" meanwhile, requires \"commit[ting] some  overt act, either by words or conduct, in furtherance of\"  the battery of Plaintiff. McKiernan v. Vaccaro, 168  A.D.3d 827, 91 N.Y.S.3d 478, 481 (App. Div. 2019);  Lindsay v. Lockwood, 163 Misc. 2d 228, 625 N.Y.S.2d  393, 397 (Sup. Ct. 1994). That, in turn, requires  \"intentional or deliberate acts directed at causing harm  which would rise [*56]  to the level of actionable conduct  in relation to the subject assault.\" Shea v. Cornell Univ.,  192 A.D.2d 857, 858, 596 N.Y.S.2d 502, 503 (1993). As explained above, the complaints are devoid of facts  which support the allegation that the acts of JP Morgan  and Deutsche Bank were specifically and intentionally  directed at causing harm to the Jane Does. Thus, the  defendants' motions to dismiss plaintiffs' claims for  aiding and abetting battery are granted. III. Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby reconfirms  its rulings in its \"bottom-line\" order of March 20, 2023.  Defendants' motions to dismiss are therefore granted in  part and denied in part, as specified below: With  respect  to  Jane  Doe  v.  Deutsche  Bank  Aktiengesellschaft et al., 22-cv-10018, the Court grants  defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to Counts II,  III, IV, V, VII, VIII, IX, and X of the First Amended  Complaint. The Court denies defendants' motion with  respect to Counts I, VI, XI, and XII of the First Amended  Complaint. Thus, for clarity, the following claims  asserted by plaintiff Jane Doe against defendants  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Deutsche Bank AG  New York Branch, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company  Americas remain as part of the case: (1) the claim that  defendants [*57]  knowingly benefited from participating  in a sex-trafficking venture, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a)(2); (2) the claim that defendants obstructed  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *53 Page 23 of 23 enforcement of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, in  violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d); (3) the claim that  defendants negligently failed to exercise reasonable  care to prevent physical harm; and (4) the claim that  defendants negligently failed to exercise reasonable  care as a banking institution providing non-routine  banking. All other claims are dismissed. With respect to Jane Doe v. JP Morgan Chase Bank,  N.A., 22-cv-10019, the Court grants defendant's motion  to dismiss with respect to Counts I, II, VI, VII, VIII, and  IX of the First Amended Complaint. The Court denies  defendant's motion with respect to Counts III, IV, V, and  X of the First Amended Complaint. Thus, for clarity, the  following claims asserted by plaintiff Jane Doe against  defendant J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. remain as  part of the case: (1) the claim that defendant negligently  failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent physical  harm; (2) the claim that defendant negligently failed to  exercise reasonable care as a banking institution  providing non-routine banking; (3) the claim that  defendant knowingly benefited from participating in  a [*58]  sex-trafficking venture, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  § 1591(a)(2); and (4) the claim that defendant  obstructed enforcement of the Trafficking Victims  Protection Act, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d). All  other claims are dismissed. With respect to Government of the United States Virgin  Islands v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 22-cv-10904,  the Court grants defendant's motion to dismiss with  respect to Counts II, III, and IV of the First Amended  Complaint. The Court denies defendant's motion with  respect to Count I of the First Amended Complaint.  Thus, for clarity, the claim of plaintiff the Government of  the United States Virgin Islands that defendant JP  Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly benefited from  participating in a sex-trafficking venture, in violation of  18 U.S.C. § 1591 (a) (2), remains as part of the case. All  other claims are dismissed. SO ORDERED. New York, NY May 1, 2023 /s/ Jed S. Rakoff JED S. RAKOFF, U.S.D.J.  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *57\n"
