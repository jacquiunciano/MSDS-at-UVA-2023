    "### New Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The last time, I created a function that would take the document, a start phrase, and an end phrase to find the narrative within the court case given. While this is proven to work, it is impossible to automate this as the start phrase and end phrase are not consistent within districts/counties/states/etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "After another careful review of the court cases given to me, I've noticed that IF the court case has a narrative section (as some documents do not), then the section will be devoid of links (so text that is blue, italized, AND underlined). Therefore, the idea for this new methodology is to extract the sections of the document where there are NO links. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rough process will be as follows:\n",
    "1. The first step is to create a list of all potential headers (like we did before)\n",
    "2. There are about 2-3 major sections that are consistent within all court cases that I've seen: Case Summary/Core Terms, Notes, and Opinion. The propbability of the narrative being in the first two sections is extremely low, so the next step would be to extact the potential headers and the corresponding text associated with them  within the Opinion section.\n",
    "3. The next step would be to go through each text between each potential header and count the number of words associated with a link (count the number of blue, italized, and underlined words).\n",
    "4. If the count=0 at the end of the scan, keep that section saved in a dictionary. The key being the potential header name and the value being a list of the words within that section. If the length of the dictionary=0 then that means that there is no narrative section within the document and the algorithm will let the user know that.\n",
    "5. The last step would be to combine the keys and values of the dictionary into one concise string of text (it may look ugly and need some cleaning).\n"

      "coercion (Penal Law § 230.34 [2], [4], [5]) to induce [***10]  defendant to engage in prostitution. As the evidence \n",

      "1. S coerced defendant to work in commercial sex for extensive hours every night from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., \n",
      "regardless of whether or not she was physically or emotionally capable of doing so, and required her to surrender \n",
      "her earnings at the end of the night. A modest sum was [**502]  returned to defendant each day that was barely \n",
      "enough to buy food.\n",
      "2. S's house rules were oppressive and coercive. For example, friends and family were not allowed to visit and \n",
      "each occupant was required to keep her room door open at all times.\n",
      "3. S threatened to evict and report the residents to the police and immigration authorities if they did not work for her \n",
      "every night.\n",

      "heard of her extreme violence toward other women in the house.\n",
      "5. S also controlled defendant's access to hormones that allowed her to physically transition and realize her true \n",
      "gender identity.\n",
      "Thus, this court finds that defendant was a victim of sex trafficking from 2003 to 2006 while under S's coercive \n",
      "control. From childhood, defendant has suffered heavily at the hands of family, \"friends\" and a number of traffickers. \n",
      "As a minor in her country of birth, she found no acceptance due to her transgender identity. Those that did accept \n",
      "her, such as another transgender woman acquaintance, taught her that transgender individuals survive through \n",
