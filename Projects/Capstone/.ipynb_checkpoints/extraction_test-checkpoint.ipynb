Tr. 50-51.2 SA Getson explained that as part of the investigation, he would identify ads from the Internet that appeared to be offering prostitution services and took special note of advertisements that listed out-of-state phone numbers. Id. at 57. As part of this process, he called about an ad listed on the female escort link on the website, \"Backpage.com,\" that listed an Arkansas phone number. Id. at 54-55. SA Getson went to the hotel later identified as Town House Inn and Suites in Omaha; SA Getson encountered Defendant, who instructed SA Getson to go to room 202. Id. at 64.

Lawson told SA Walsh that Defendant was in custody of her driver\\'s license and her room key, and that she was in love with Defendant. Id. at 84. Although Lawson was unwilling to communicate further with SA Walsh, she opened up when she realized she could leave if she cooperated. Id. at 85. After speaking with Lawson, SA Walsh observed Addison in the backseat of a police vehicle, very closed off, hunched over with a wad of tissues in her hand and smeared make-up all over her face. Id. at 86-87. SA Walsh testified that Addison looked very scared, and that SA Walsh thought Addison was sitting in the vehicle for safety. Id. at 87.FBI Special Agent Chad Hankins (SA Hankins) testified that he was the agent in charge of collecting all of [*12]  the evidence seized at the Town House Inn and Suites operation on June 18, 2011.

Id. at 717-18.The Government also presented the testimonies of several women who worked as Defendant\\'s prostitutes. Jennifer Olewnik (Olewnik) testified that she came from a broken home and was shuttled back and forth between her mother and father, that she was hospitalized several times for psychiatric problems, and that she was eventually prescribed medication for anxiety and bipolar disorder. Id. at 103-05. Olewnik dropped out of school, became pregnant, and had a daughter when she was seventeen. Id. at 113-14. Olewnik became involved in drugs and eventually relinquished custody of [*13]  her daughter to her mother. Id. In January 2010, after a period of drug and alcohol abuse, homelessness, and entanglement with law enforcement, Olewnik moved in with her mother and other family members in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Id. at 117. Olewnik met Defendant at a bar in the summer of 2010. Id. at 118. Defendant told Olewnik he was from New Jersey and that he was going through a divorce. Id. at 119. Olewnik said that she and Defendant began an intimate relationship and that they kept in touch after he returned to New Jersey. Id. Around that time, Olewnik was hospitalized for about two weeks; when she got out of the hospital, she started seeing Defendant. Id. at 120. Olewnik described having feelings for Defendant, that she really cared for him, and that Defendant told her he loved her. Id. at 121-22.In the fall of 2010, Defendant asked Olewnik if she wanted to start making some money working for him as a prostitute. Id. at 121. Defendant promised Olewnik that if she worked as a prostitute for him, he would take care of her and make sure she had everything she needed. Id. at 120. Defendant told Olewnik he would be with her for a long time, she would no longer have to work from nine to five, that he would help her get her daughter back, and that they [*14]  would have children together. Id. at 122-23. Olewnik said that at the time, she had regular employment but that \"the dreams Mr. Bell threw out at [her] sounded much better than that,\" so on or about November 1, 2010, Olewnik agreed to begin prostituting for Defendant; Olewnik said that before that time, she had never engaged in nor considered engaging in prostitution. Id. at 124-25.Once Olewnik agreed to be Defendant\\'s prostitute, Defendant took Olewnik away from her home and her daughter in Philadelphia, to New Jersey, and then to Maryland to be trained as a prostitute. Id. at 126-27. Olewnik learned Page 8 of 21 that she had to give all the money she earned to Defendant and that she was never to talk to other pimps because it would be disrespectful to Defendant. Id. at 123, 130. Olewnik explained that Defendant advertised Olewnik\\'s services through the Backpage.com website and that customers contacted Defendant at the e-mail address, \"Gogetemtiger84@yahoo.com.\" Id. at 136. Olewnik testified that the advertisements included her photograph, the sex acts that were available, how much the services cost, and Olewnik\\'s location. Id. at 199.After leaving Maryland, Defendant arranged to take Olewnik and other prostitutes to Columbia, South Carolina, and then to Little Rock, [*15]  Arkansas, to engage in commercial sex acts4 mostly at truck stops. Id. at 137, 144. Olewnik testified that while they were in Little Rock, she told Defendant that she did not want to prostitute for him at truck stops. Id. at 144-45. Defendant told Olewnik, \"you have no choice,\" and when Olewnik continued to refuse, Defendant beat her with a belt until she agreed to work the truck stops for him. Id.By December 10, 2010, Defendant took on another prostitute, Courtney Mayberry (Mayberry). Id. at 148. When Olewnik found out Defendant started a relationship with Mayberry, Olewnik threatened to call the police. Id. Defendant struck Olewnik in the face, causing her to fall over; Olewnik stumbled into the bathtub, and Defendant began choking her and telling Olewnik that if she ever threatened to call the cops again, he would kill Olewnik and her family, especially her daughter. Id. at 151. Olewnik called her mother and said she wanted to come home, but she was not ready to give up drugs, which was her mother\\'s condition if Olewnik returned. Id. at 153-55. Olewnik also told her mother that she still cared for Defendant and hoped he would keep his promises, and [*16]  Olewnik decided to stay with Defendant for the time being. Id. at 154-55.Olewnik testified that in January 2011, Defendant brought Lawson on as another prostitute. Id. at 159. After that, Olewnik and Mayberry left Defendant and went out on their own. Id. at 160-64. Olewnik worked as a prostitute for Mayberry; the money was used to buy drugs. Id. at 161-62. Olewnik left Mayberry and moved in with a drug dealer, but in March, with nowhere to go, Olewnik called Defendant because she still cared for him and wanted to feel safe. Id. at 163. The only people she knew in Arkansas were crack dealers, pimps, Defendant, and Mayberry. Id. at 165. Defendant told Olewnik if she came back, she had to work and be loyal to him. Id. Olewnik testified that she believed she had a future with Defendant, but she could not be disrespectful to him again. Id. at 163-64.After traveling to several cities in the southern United States for prostitution, Defendant left Olewnik in a hotel room in Augusta, Georgia, to perform commercial sex acts while he had Lawson and another girl — Francesca — work for him in South Carolina. Id. at 171-72. Defendant posted ads for all three girls during this period of time, even though Olewnik was left in Augusta. Id. at 172. Olewnik continued to perform commercial sex acts, [*17]  per Defendant\\'s instructions, until Defendant returned. Id. When Defendant returned to the Augusta hotel, he found Olewnik sleeping, so he slapped her and kicked her when she fell to the floor. Id. at 173. His physical abuse caused Olewnik to suffer bruising on her ribs and her face. Id. After beating Olewnik, Defendant warned her that she better not fall asleep unless she had enough money to give to Defendant when he returned. Id.Following the beating in Augusta, Defendant continued to physically abuse Olewnik by slapping her in the face and otherwise treating her roughly. Id. at 173-74. He also made threats to her and her family if she ever left Defendant, lied to him, or told the police about him. Id. at 174. Olewnik also noticed Defendant taking a gun with him when they traveled in the summer of 2011. Id. at 175-76. Defendant also made it clear that he had other people to carry out his threats if necessary, whether against Olewnik, her family, or her daughter. Id. at 211.In May of 2011, Lawson and Olewnik traveled with Defendant to Des Moines, Iowa, to perform commercial sex acts at Defendant\\'s instruction. Id. at 180-81. Following that trip, the group went to Denver, Colorado, where they all got tattoos. Id. at 182. Defendant had Lawson get a tattoo of one [*18]  of his pimp nicknames, \"Bam.\" Id. at 182-83. Shortly after the trip to Denver, Olewnik was arrested in the Shreveport and Bossier City area for prostitution. Id. at 184. Olewnik did not tell the police about Defendant, as she was scared of him. Id. at 185, 211. When Olewnik was let out of jail on bond, she was picked up by Lawson, Defendant, and T.A., as well as T.A.\\'s two children. Id. at 188.4 Olewnik testified that commercial sex acts included vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Tr. 126-27.Page 9 of 21 Within the next few days, Defendant drove T.A. back home so she could leave her kids there and come back, and T.A. brought her sister, Addison, back with her. Id. at 189-90. While the group was in Texarkana, Texas, T.A. was posted for commercial sex acts; and although Addison also may have been posted, Addison did not actually perform any commercial sex acts. Id. at 191. Olewnik testified that she thought Defendant wanted to have Addison work for him because the only reason Defendant kept a female around was as a prostitution recruit. Id. at 191-92. After working in Texarkana for a few days, the group took T.A. back to Hot Springs and went on to Fayetteville. Id. at 192. After they had spent a few days in Fayetteville, the group traveled to Des Moines to perform commercial sex acts. Id. at 195. Olewnik, Lawson, and Addison were all posted for commercial sex acts while in Des Moines in June of 2011. [*19]  Id. at 196.Olewnik testified that Defendant routinely physically abused her if she upset him in any way, so she attempted to follow his every command, including performing for customers an anal sex act referred to as a \"Backyard Special,\" even though it hurt Olewnik and she hated it. Id. at 149-51, 173-74, 197-98. Defendant\\'s commands also required her to pose in ads for a \"Backyard Special\" in Des Moines on June 16, 2011. Id. at 206-07. Olewnik confirmed that on June 15, 2011, Lawson and Addison were posted for a two-girl session in Des Moines. Id. at 207-08. While Addison was with the group, Olewnik told Addison that Defendant had physically abused Olewnik in the past and that Defendant beat her after she fell asleep in Augusta, Georgia. Id. at 213. Olewnik had also told Mayberry about Defendant\\'s abuses, and Mayberry witnessed the bathtub incident herself. Id. at 216.Immediately after the police investigation broke up Defendant\\'s group on June 18, 2011, Olewnik entered the Walter Hoving Home in New York, which is an all-women\\'s Christian-based rehabilitation facility. Id. at 218. After being there for a brief period of time, she went to the Friends Hospital (Friends) for treatment. Id. at 219. While at Friends, Olewnik told her treatment team that she had been physically, emotionally, [*20]  and mentally abused by Defendant, referring to him as her ex-boyfriend and pimp. Id. at 220. Olewnik was at Friends approximately two weeks before she moved in with her father for a brief period of time and then lived in Philadelphia with her mother. Id. at 220-21.Olewnik later joined Lawson in New Orleans, Louisiana, with a new pimp for whom Lawson was working. Id. at 221. Olewnik stayed with Lawson and her pimp for a few weeks, and she performed commercial sex acts and gave any money she earned to the pimp. Id. at 221-22. Lawson and Olewnik left the first pimp and went to another pimp after a few weeks, and they again prostituted to make money for the new pimp. Id. at 222. Olewnik wanted to get her daughter back, so Lawson sent Olewnik to a pimp she knew who may be able to help Olewnik; Olewnik stayed at that location until November of 2011. Id. at 222-23. A few weeks before Thanksgiving, Olewnik met up with Mayberry and started prostituting and giving the money she earned to Mayberry. Id. at 223-24. Olewnik left Mayberry after a month to stay with Lawson and her boyfriend, and she eventually sought treatment again at Friends in the spring of 2012. Id. at 225-26. Since her stay at Friends in 2012, Olewnik has continued to use marijuana with her mother, but she has stayed out [*21]  of prostitution and stopped using any other drugs. Id. at 226-27. Olewnik estimated that while she was with Defendant, she worked almost every day for Defendant, earned approximately $50,000 as a prostitute for Defendant, and all that money went to Defendant. Id. at 228.The Government also presented testimonies of individuals who worked with Olewnik at the Walter Hoving Home and Friends Hospital. Susan Hinton (Hinton) is the Deputy Director of the Walter Hoving Home (Home) in Garrison, New York. Id. at 403. The Home is a facility that tries to help women through Biblical principles, job skills training, and a safe, loving environment. Id. at 404. Olewnik entered the Home in June of 2011 for assistance.

Friends is an acute psychiatric hospital, and it treats individuals who have dual diagnoses, meaning the person has a drug or alcohol problem as well as mental health issues. Id. at 411. As part of Olewnik\\'s [*22]  treatment team at Friends, Hall learned that Olewnik had been admitted to Friends several times, starting as early as age 13 or 14. Id. at 412-14. Hall testified that she had been more recently admitted on August 31, 2011. Id. at 416-17. At the time she was admitted, she said she had been physically abused by her ex-boyfriend turned pimp. Id. at 418. Additionally, Olewnik admitted Page 10 of 21 having a history of using crack cocaine, intravenous cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol, and that she had been sober of drugs and alcohol at least two months prior to her admission at Friends. Id. at 419. She had last worked as a prostitute on June 18, 2011, had completed the ninth grade, and her two-year-old daughter still lived with her mother — the child\\'s grandmother. Id. at 420. Olewnik also told staff at Friends that she had suicidal thoughts and had been prostituted, pimped out, and mistreated, as well as \"[p]hysically, emotionally and mentally abused by a pimp.\" Id. at 423-27, 432, 434-35. Olewnik requested to be admitted to Keystone, which is an inpatient rehabilitation center, where she had been admitted in the past. Id. at 423.Olewnik\\'s mother, Sharon Olewnik White (White), testified at trial that Olewnik\\'s father used to beat White, and she eventually obtained a restraining order against him. Id. at 381-82. Olewnik [*23]  grew up with emotional and anger issues, which White attributed to the fact that Olewnik witnessed her father physically abusing White. Id. at 382-83. White also testified that Olewnik cried a lot because her father was never there when Olewnik needed him. Id. at 384. Due to this strained relationship, White believes that Olewnik is looking for a father figure in her relationships with men. Id. Olewnik\\'s mother also testified about Olewnik\\'s emotional issues, as she cries often, gets angry easily, and suffers from both depression and anxiety. Id. at 385.White discussed Olewnik\\'s mental health treatment, testifying that Olewnik was first admitted to a treatment center in third grade and was again hospitalized in ninth grade. Id. at 386-87. Olewnik stayed in a shelter for a period of time when her daughter was born, and she eventually moved back in with White. Id. at 388-91. White testified that Olewnik continued to lash out at White after moving back, and Olewnik stole money and used marijuana and cocaine. Id. at 391. White admitted using marijuana with Olewnik. Id. at 393-94.In 2010, Olewnik was again admitted for mental health treatment, this time at Friends. Id. at 394. White recalled that Olewnik left the house and joined Defendant for a long period of time. Id. at 395-96. During that [*24]  period of time, when White spoke on the phone with Olewnik, Olewnik would tell her mother that Defendant hit her; and on one phone call in particular, Olewnik was crying heavily and telling White she wanted to come home. Id. at 398-99. White said that she responded to Olewnik that Olewnik could come home, but she could only do so if she was going to be a mother to her baby girl, which would include ending her illegal activities. Id. at 396-97.Lawson, who was indicted as a co-defendant in this case, testified that she entered into a plea agreement with the Government, which, in pertinent part, provided that in exchange for her cooperation and testimony for the Government at Defendant\\'s trial, Lawson hoped to obtain a lesser sentence. Id. at 453.Lawson told the jury that she became engaged in prostitution when she was 17, working for an individual named Joanie Martin. Id. at 456-57. Lawson first met Defendant in Hot Springs, Arkansas, in December of 2010 or early January of 2011, when he called in response to a prostitution ad Lawson had posted on Backpage.com. Id. at 455-58. Lawson said that when they met, he took her out on a date and did not mention prostitution. Id. at 458. The next day, Defendant asked Lawson to come with him, promising her he would [*25]  better her life and would make sure she did not have to worry about anything anymore. Id. at 459. Defendant made Lawson believe that he wanted to have a romantic relationship with her, telling her she was beautiful and smart, and that she could have children, happiness, trust, and loyalty with him. Id. at 460. Lawson testified that Defendant never mentioned to her that he was involved in the prostitution business. Id. at 462-63.Lawson left with the Defendant and went to the motel in Little Rock where Defendant was staying. At that time, she first learned that she would be joining Defendant\\'s group of girls — Olewnik and Mayberry. Id. at 461-62. Before meeting Olewnik and Mayberry, Lawson had no idea that Defendant was a pimp or that he expected Lawson to prostitute for him. Id. at 462. On the night that Lawson joined the group, Lawson stayed in one room and had sex with Defendant, while Mayberry and Olewnik stayed in separate rooms. Id. at 465-68. The next morning, Defendant went to Mayberry\\'s and Olewnik\\'s rooms and discovered that they \"ran away\" and took some of Defendant\\'s belongings, including the computer Defendant used for posting prostitution ads. Id. at 465-68, 479. Lawson testified that Defendant spent the next several days trying to convince Olewnik and Mayberry [*26]  to return. During that time, she and Defendant continued to have a personal, intimate relationship, and that Defendant continued to make promises to her that he would take care of her and they would have a future together. Id. at 472.Page 11 of 21 About two weeks into their relationship, Defendant, who had left Lawson at her grandparent\\'s home while he looked for Olewnik and Mayberry, returned and had run out of money. Id. at 472-73. Defendant asked Lawson to start prostituting for him. Id. at 473. When Lawson agreed, Defendant rented two hotel rooms, posted Lawson\\'s ad on Backpage.com, and gave her instructions about what she needed to do as his prostitute. Id. at 472-73. Defendant told Lawson she was not allowed to talk to other pimps or to sleep with black men. Id. at 473. She was not even allowed to make eye contact with others in the business, and she was not allowed to talk to other prostitutes without Defendant\\'s permission. Id. at 481. Defendant determined the pricing for Lawson\\'s services. and Lawson was required to give all of the money to Defendant. Id. at 474-75. At this time, Lawson was still in a relationship with Defendant, and she was starting to fall in love with him. Id. Lawson described that Defendant had made her his \"Bottom Bitch\" — his assistant or second-in-command [*27]  for purposes of running the \"business.\" Id. at 478. Lawson and the other girls were required to post every day for purposes of advertising to engage in commercial sex acts to make Defendant money. Id. at 479. Lawson testified that Defendant convinced Olewnik to come back to him by promising her that everything would be better, that he would keep her safe and care for her, that she could come home to \"Daddy.\" Id. at 487. Defendant had Lawson communicate similar promises to others to convince them to join the group as well. Id. at 491-92.Lawson testified that she, Defendant, Mayberry, and Olewnik traveled as a group for purposes of prostitution throughout the country, including through Iowa, and that they occasionally met up with other pimps. Id. at 481-83. Lawson confirmed at trial that Defendant, Lawson, and Olewnik stayed in Des Moines, Iowa, from May 11, 2011, through May 17, 2011, and that during their stay, Olewnik and Lawson were posted for and performed commercial sex acts, and that they again gave all money they earned to Defendant. Id. at 510-13. Larson also testified that on a trip to Denver, Colorado, at Defendant\\'s direction, Lawson got a tattoo of one of Defendant\\'s pimp nicknames, \"Bam.\" Id. at 487. Lawson described that when a prostitute has a tattoo [*28]  of her pimp\\'s name, \"[s]he\\'s branded\" and others know that the prostitute belongs to the pimp. Id. at 487-88.Lawson left Defendant for a brief period of time. Lawson said that she returned, however, after Defendant told her how much he wanted her to come back to him, and that he loved her, he was there for her, and she was still his girl. Id. at 503. Near the end of her time with Defendant in 2011, Lawson learned that Defendant had made similar promises to Mayberry and Olewnik before moving on to Lawson. Id. at 504.In early June 2011, while the group was in Shreveport and Bossier, Louisiana, Olewnik was arrested for prostitution. Id. at 527. Lawson and Defendant left the Shreveport area and went to Texarkana because Lawson had been posted in the same ad as Olewnik, and Defendant was concerned law enforcement would come to the hotel looking for Lawson. Id. at 517-18. While Olewnik was in jail, Lawson invited her friend T.A. and T.A.\\'s kids to join her and Defendant at the hotel for the weekend. Id. at 523. Lawson testified that she invited T.A. with the intention of leaving with T.A. to get away from Defendant. Id. at 523. At some point during that weekend, Lawson and Defendant went back to Shreveport to pick up Olewnik, who Defendant bailed out of jail, and the [*29]  three of them returned to the hotel in Texarkana. Id. at 524. Shortly after that, Defendant left with T.A. and T.A.\\'s kids to drop off the kids and then T.A. and Defendant returned to the hotel in Texarkana. Id. at 525-26.Around June 11, 2011, T.A. met up with her sister, Addison, in Hot Springs; Defendant took the rental car and picked up both T.A. and Addison. Id. at 535. Lawson and Defendant took photos of Addison at the pool on the first night Addison was with the group, and they posted her in Texarkana. Id. at 536. Lawson testified that Defendant spoke with Addison about prostitution, but it was always when Defendant was alone with Addison. Id. Lawson did witness Defendant threatening the girls that if they ever told the police about him, he would harm the girl and her family; Addison, who had a young daughter, was present for this warning. Id. at 542, 580-81.Defendant instructed Lawson to teach Addison how to work as a prostitute in preparation for any calls she would have in the future. Id. at 536-37. Defendant and Lawson described Addison as \"green,\" because she was new to the prostitution business. Id. at 581. Lawson also learned during her time training Addison that Addison did not want to perform commercial sex acts. Id. at 583-84.From Texarkana, Defendant, Olewnik, [*30]  Lawson, and Addison traveled to Fayetteville for prostitution on June 13 and 14, 2011. Id. at 537-38, 542. Although Addison was posted for sex acts in Fayetteville, she did not go on Page 12 of 21 any calls. Id. at 540. From Fayetteville, the group traveled to Des Moines, where all three girls were again posted for sex acts on June 15, 16, and 17, 2011. Id. at 543, 545, 548. In Des Moines, Olewnik was also posted for a \"Backyard Special.\" Id. at 545. On June 17, 2011, Lawson and Addison were posted for a \"2 Girl Special,\" meaning the client can engage in sex acts with both women at the same time. Id. at 549. Lawson and Addison received a call for that type of posting in Des Moines, and Addison engaged in sex acts for money for the first time. Id. at 553-54.By June 18, 2011, the group was in Omaha, and ads of Lawson, Olewnik, and Addison had been posted for commercial sex acts. Id. at 550-51, 208-09. Defendant, Lawson, and Addison stayed in one room, while Olewnik had her own room. Id. at 559. On June 18, 2011, Olewnik took a call from a client that turned out to be SA Brewer. Id. Law enforcement questioned all four of them; Defendant and Olewnik were arrested. Id. at 559-60. Lawson and Addison were questioned by the agents and agreed to cooperate with the investigation. Id. at 633. Lawson said that after the raid, she observed [*31]  Addison as Addison was questioned by the agents, and described Addison as being \"very, very upset\" and \"terrified.\" Id. at 583. Lawson also testified that Addison did not want to perform commercial sex acts and that Defendant had threatened all the woman, including Addison, that \"if anybody ever snitched on him, he would harm them and their family.\" Id. at 582.Lawson was asked about Olewnik\\'s relationship with Defendant and testified that Olewnik was in love with Defendant. Id. at 618-19. She also testified that Defendant made Olewnik perform the \"Backyard Special\" on many occasions. Id. at 530-31. Lawson confirmed that Olewnik was forced by Defendant to perform anal sex for money, including on June 16, 2011, when Olewnik\\'s ad was posted in Des Moines. Id. at 624. Lawson witnessed Defendant get mad at Olewnik for little things, had \"thrown her on the floor,\" \"smack her for doing stuff,\" and in other ways physically abused Olewnik. Id. at 620. Defendant also told Lawson about several times he had physically abused Olewnik, including when he beat Olewnik in the bathtub and another time where he and a friend \"ran a train\" on Olewnik, meaning both men had sex with Olewnik in quick succession. Id. at 620-21. Lawson heard Defendant regularly threaten to hit Olewnik [*32]  and to harm her daughter. Id. at 621-22. He would make such threats especially when Olewnik told Defendant she did not want to perform sex acts for money, including the \"Backyard Special.\" Id. at 622-23. Lawson testified that Olewnik was very easily influenced and manipulated, as she \"had the mind of a child.\" Id. at 623. Lawson also testified that the Defendant spoke often to his own mother, who also was involved in prostitution. Id. at 476. Lawson said that Defendant\\'s mother also talked to Lawson on the phone, telling her to take care of her son, that Lawson was part of the family, and that Lawson did not need to talk to law enforcement about Defendant. Id. at 476-78, 679-80.Mayberry also testified at trial. She described that as a young girl, she was mentally, physically, and verbally abused by her family, including her grandparents and her mother. Id. at 722. She was also raped as a child. Id. at 722-23. Because her parents were in and out of prison due to their drug use, legal custody was given to her grandmother for a period of time. Id. at 723. When she was fourteen, Mayberry attempted suicide and was hospitalized, and her grandmother subsequently gave up legal custody of Mayberry to the State of Arkansas. Id. at 723-24. Mayberry was placed in a foster home, and she soon began using marijuana, [*33]  cocaine, and other controlled substances. Id. at 724. Mayberry ran away from foster care when she was sixteen and began prostituting herself and living on the streets. Id. at 725.When Mayberry met Olewnik and Defendant in Little Rock, Mayberry was eighteen, engaged in prostitution, using drugs, homeless, and barely getting by on her own. Id. at 726-28. Mayberry accepted Olewnik\\'s invitation to meet Defendant, who Olewnik described as her pimp. Id. at 728. At their first meeting, Defendant suggested that Mayberry join them in the prostitution business. Id. He promised her that it would be better for her to join them and that if they made enough money, they could stop prostituting. Id. at 729. He also promised Mayberry that when the prostituting was over, he wanted to be with her and only her. Id.Mayberry was somewhat concerned about joining Defendant, as she saw Olewnik had belt welts on her body. Id. at 729-30. Olewnik warned Mayberry that when she met Defendant she could not lie to him, referring to Defendant as \"Daddy.\" Id. Mayberry still joined the Defendant, and she immediately became his \"Bottom Bitch.\" Id. at 730-31.Page 13 of 21 At the beginning of Mayberry\\'s time with Defendant and Olewnik, Defendant wrote poetry for Mayberry with promises that the girls could retire [*34]  after they made enough money, and how it would be just Defendant and Mayberry together after it was all over. Id. at 733. Mayberry started falling for Defendant, and she thought he felt the same way. Id. Defendant told Mayberry he was not married, that his daughter\\'s mom was his ex-wife, and that they were divorced. Id. at 733-34.Mayberry testified about the abusive treatment Olewnik endured while working for Defendant, including the incident on the first day Mayberry joined Defendant where Defendant accused Olewnik of lying to him, Olewnik threatened to call the police, and Defendant hit Olewnik over and over again. Id. at 735. Mayberry said that Olewnik cried and asked Defendant to stop, but he beat her into the bathroom and she ended up in the bathtub. Id. at 735-36. Defendant would not stop beating Olewnik until Mayberry finally told him to stop. Id. at 737. Mayberry did not witness other attacks, but she knew Defendant was abusing Olewnik because of the bruises on Olewnik\\'s body. Id. at 736. Defendant instructed Mayberry that while she worked for him, she was not allowed to look at or talk to other pimps. Id. at 740.Mayberry described that when Lawson joined the group, Mayberry and Olewnik left Defendant, as they knew that he had made promises to both [*35]  of them and that he would likely make the same promises to Lawson. Id. at 751-53. Mayberry described Olewnik at trial as not being as smart as Mayberry, because Olewnik\\'s mind was like that of a child, not really based in reality. Id. at 753-54. After leaving Defendant, Mayberry said that the two girls continued performing commercial sex acts, and that she kept control of any money they earned. Id. at 754. During their time together, both girls used opiates, marijuana, and cocaine, and they purchased these drugs with the money they made through prostitution. Id. at 754-55. Mayberry hit Olewnik on one occasion, and shortly after that altercation, Olewnik left Mayberry to go back to Defendant. Id. at 756. A short time later, Mayberry returned to Defendant because of promises he made through letters, saying that he missed her and wanted her back with him. Id. at 757-59. Mayberry left Defendant before June of 2011, so she never came in contact with Addison. Id. at 761.Addison testified that she met Defendant in Texarkana, but at that time, she was living in Hot Springs. Id. at 798. Addison was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when she was thirteen, and she has a daughter who is currently four years old, making her about two years old when Addison met Defendant in 2011. Id. at 798-99. When [*36]  Addison met Defendant, she had never engaged in prostitution, and she thought she was joining her sister, T.A., and T.A.\\'s friends to party for the weekend. Id. at 799. On the first day Addison joined the group, she saw the other girls post pictures online, and she later learned they were posting the photos to Backpage.com for prostitution. Id. at 800. She testified that when she left Hot Springs to join the group in Texarkana, she did not know they were engaged in prostitution. Id. at 800-01.Later that day, Addison went to the gas station with Defendant, where he told her he wanted her to work for him as a prostitute. Id. at 801-02. Defendant told Addison she could not go home, and if she talked to the police he would hurt her and her family. Id. at 802. Defendant required Addison to change her cell phone number, telling Addison that \"nobody needed to have [Addison\\'s] phone number except for tricks.\" Id. at 811.Addison did not remember being posted for prostitution in Texarkana, but she knows she was posted on Backpage.com, in Fayetteville, which was their next stop. Id. Addison testified that she was posted against her will, as she did not want to engage in prostitution. Id. at 802-03. She testified that T.A. voluntarily posed for pictures for Backpage.com [*37]  postings in June of 2011. Id. at 803-04. Addison testified that when the group traveled from Texarkana to Fayetteville, it was at Defendant\\'s direction, and he drove the car. Id. at 805-06. Defendant made it clear that Addison was not allowed to leave, even though she missed her daughter, because he also did not get to go home to his children. Id. at 806-07. In Fayetteville, Defendant posted Addison on Backpage.com, but she did not want him to post her. Id. at 807-08. She said that it appeared most of the photos Defendant posted of her were from her Facebook page. Id. at 810. In addition to posting Addison online, Defendant made Addison change her phone number so it would only be used for prostitution calls. Id. at 811. He also kept possession of her phone unless she was answering prostitution calls or talking to her mother in a supervised setting. Id. at 812.After a few days in Fayetteville, the group traveled to Des Moines for prostitution. Id. at 813. In Des Moines, Addison was posted by Defendant for a two-girl special with Lawson, and she engaged in a commercial sex act for Page 14 of 21 a customer along with Lawson on June 17, 2011. Id. at 814-15, 819-20. The money earned from that act of prostitution went to Defendant. Id. at 815. Addison testified that she did not want to participate in the sex act, but she [*38]  felt like she had to because Defendant told her she could not go home, and she would rather work for Defendant than put her family in danger. Id. at 816. While she was in Des Moines, Addison attempted to manipulate Defendant into letting her go home, but she was unable to do so. Id. at 820. She stayed with Defendant to protect herself, her family, and especially her daughter. Id. Additionally, she did not even know where she was, as she was not familiar with the cities she was visiting, so she was unsure how to get police help. Id. Defendant even ordered Addison that she was not allowed to talk to the other girls about how she wanted to go home or about the fact that Defendant wanted to make her his new \"Bottom Bitch.\" Id. at 828-29.In addition to Defendant making Addison engage in prostitution, Addison testified that she also engaged in sexual activity with Defendant involuntarily, because she was scared of him and thought she had to do anything he told her to do. Id. at 829-30. Addison saw Olewnik and Defendant argue multiple times, and she knew he threatened to hit Olewnik in the past. Id. at 831. Defendant used to tell Olewnik that her family did not care about her, and that she was doing more for her daughter by prostituting herself [*39]  for Defendant than by going home to her child. Id. Additionally, Addison witnessed Lawson tell Defendant about something Olewnik refused to do, and Defendant started talking about physically abusing Olewnik. Id. During their travels, Defendant told Olewnik, Lawson, and Addison that if they were caught by the police and tried to snitch on him, he would kill the girls and their families, and that for every year he was locked up, he would make sure a member of their family was killed. Id. at 832. After spending one week with Defendant, Lawson, and Olewnik, Addison observed that Lawson and Defendant had a \"messed up relationship,\" and that Defendant treated Olewnik as \"his slave.\" Id. at 834.After a few days in Des Moines, the group traveled to Omaha for prostitution. Id. at 820-21. Defendant made this decision and he transported the girls from Des Moines to Omaha. Id. at 821. On June 18, 2011, when the group was in Omaha, Addison confirmed that the police broke up the group after Olewnik was busted by an undercover police officer. Id. at 823. During their testimonies, all four women identified various photographs of themselves that had been posted on Backpage.com for the purpose of advertising commercial sex acts.

       "\"1. Findings of FactDefendant was the only witness who testified at the hearing and the court finds her to be credible. Defendant testified that she had originally [***8]  agreed to stay with S under a rental agreement for $500 per month for a room. Defendant stated, however, that upon her arrival, she was informed that the only way she could remain in the house would be if she engaged in prostitution for the benefit of S. These terms were common to all of the other residents at the house who, like defendant, were transgender women forced by S to engage in commercial sex work on the street at a location chosen by S. Defendant testified that she was required to work every night without exception, typically seeing six to eight clients each night while working from 6:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m. Defendant was forced to surrender the money she earned to S, receiving a small amount back at the end of each night. As a result, defendant stated that she ultimately paid S more than the promised rent of $500, with the excess money coming from her earnings. S also provided the residents with hormones which the women could not obtain on their own. If defendant failed to earn the expected amount of money, S would threaten to kick her out and stop providing hormones, which was important to her gender identity. S's house rules and regulations were strict and oppressive, including [***9]  a prohibition against visitors and the requirement that the residents work every day. On days when defendant was physically incapable of working, S threatened to throw her out onto the streets and call law enforcement. S's threats to call the police if defendant disobeyed her constantly placed defendant's immigration status in jeopardy.13 Defense counsel acknowledged that she did not fully apprehend the complexities and nuances of trafficking at the time of defendant's initial interview with the People.14 Defendant references interview guidance from chapter 11 of the Lawyer's Manual on Human Trafficking (Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, First Department and New York State Judicial Committee on Women in the Courts, Lawyer's Manual on Human Trafficking: Pursuing Justice for Victims [2013, Jill Laurie Goodman & Dorchen A. Leidholdt eds]) and the Forensic Experimental Trauma Interview approach to trauma survivors (Russell Strand, Battered Women's Justice Project, Shifting the Paradigm for Investigating Trauma Victimization [Mar. 2014], https://www.bwjp.org/resource-center/resource-results/shifting-the-paradigm-for-investigating-trauma-victimization.html).64 Misc. 3d 344, *348; 100 N.Y.S.3d 496, **500; 2019 N.Y.

She stated that although S exploited her, her later two traffickers hurt her much more, both physically and emotionally. Defendant also felt that while she resided with S, she was also living with her friends who were the other similarly exploited transgender women. [*351] \""

       "\"FACTS¶3 This prosecution arises from the protracted, poignant, and pungent relationship between Jane, [***3]  a pseudonym, and defendant Lars Braun. The four-year relationship included the performance of commercial sex acts by Jane at the request of and for the financial gain and sexual enchantment of Braun. Braun's appeal raises two principal questions: First, whether Braun, within the meaning of Washington's human trafficking statute, meted “force, coercion, and fraud” against Jane in fulfillment of one of the crime's elements? Second, whether the force, coercion, or fraud led to Jane's prostitution in satisfaction of a second element of the crime? Answers to these questions require a review of the language, intent, and history behind RCW 9A.40.100, Washington's trafficking statute. Answering the questions also necessitates a narrative of Jane's remarkable story, remarkable not because of its singularity or the tragedy portrayed but because of the prevalence, yet hidden nature, of trafficking and because of the story's example of how enduring manipulation can implausibly result in the control of another's choices, even to the extent of causing the other to perform repulsive and dangerous acts. We  [**888]  glean the appeal's facts primarily from the trial testimony of Jane.¶4 In February 2013, Jane began communicating [***4]  with Lars Braun over the Internet. Jane was then twenty years old and married. Braun was in his early fifties and also married. Jane lived in Spokane, and Braun resided in Ellensburg. Jane knew Braun's children through her husband,  [*761]  who socialized with the offspring. In her cyber messages to Braun, Jane expressed concern about the methamphetamine intake of Braun's children.¶5 At the same time that Jane started writing Lars Braun, she commenced abusing alcohol. Her alcohol use created conflict in her marriage.¶6 By April 2013, Lars Braun and Jane spoke by phone or communicated by e-mail several hours each day. Jane then admired Braun, thirty years her senior, as an accomplished intellectual. Jane divulged her marital problems. Braun advised Jane to engage in an extramarital affair. Braun expounded that he rekindled his marriage by cheating on his wife.¶7 In May 2013, Lars Braun and Jane met in person for the first time and interlocked in sexual intercourse inside a Spokane hotel room. By May, Braun and his wife were in the process of divorce. Jane's husband soon learned of her carnal encounter with Braun. Jane moved from her husband's residence and divorced him.¶8 Lars Braun learned that Jane informed [***5]  Jane's husband of her sexual encounter with Braun. Braun grew furious at Jane because he worried that his wife would also hear about the affair and use the tryst against him in their divorce and child custody proceeding. Braun ceased speaking with Jane.¶9 Alas, the lack of interaction between Lars Braun and Jane did not last. While Jane engaged in intimate relations with another man, Braun called Jane. We do not know why Jane answered the phone during this rendezvous. During the telephone conversation, Braun screamed at Jane. Braun called Jane “‘slut.’” Clerk's Papers (CP) at 253-54. Braun's clamorous comments suggested to Jane that Braun was jealous. The remarks also surprised Jane since Braun had told her he would never speak to her again. Braun and Jane spoke by phone on additional occasions in the coming days. Jane repeatedly apologized to Braun. Braun revealed to Jane she was his girlfriend. [*762] ¶10 In early June 2013, Lars Braun invited Jane to visit him in Ellensburg, where he would introduce her to his friends. Jane lacked a driver's license. So Jane traveled by bus from Spokane to Ellensburg to visit Braun. Braun there purchased alcohol for Jane, since she remained below the legal age [***6]  to purchase liquor. Contrary to his telephonic enticement, Braun hid his relationship with Jane from acquaintances in Ellensburg. He directed her to use the name “Kathy,” and he informed others that “Kathy” and he shared a platonic relationship. During the first visit, Braun permitted his seven-year-old son to enter the bed where Braun and Jane lay naked.¶11 Dave, with an unidentified last name, also resided with Lars Braun in Ellensburg during Jane's early June 2013 visit. On one day, Braun left Jane alone with Dave, during which time Dave groped Jane. Dave informed Jane that Braun gave him permission to have sex with her. Jane refused Dave's overture, after which Dave 20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *759; 502 P.3d 884, **887; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***2Page 3 of 18 punched the bed by her head. Jane ran into and locked herself in a bathroom, while crying hysterically. She texted Braun and requested he return to the residence. Braun declined. When Braun eventually returned home, he accused Jane of promoting the advance by Dave because of her suggestible behavior. Braun questioned Jane about why she did not strike Dave if she objected to the housemate's advance. Braun volunteered that she encouraged Dave to engage in sex with her. He instructed Jane not to report Dave to law enforcement. [***7]  Braun then initiated sex with Jane. Jane never saw Dave again.¶12 At 2:00 a.m. on the morning following Dave's sexual assault, Lars Braun deposited Jane at the Ellensburg Greyhound station. Braun instructed Jane to leave Ellensburg. Jane lacked money for a ticket but, after pleading with the bus driver, received a free ride to Spokane. [**889] ¶13 After her return to Spokane, Jane resided with her parents, but encountered difficulty living with them. Weeks [*763]  later, Lars Braun offered to allow Jane to live with him in Ellensburg. Late in June 2013, Jane returned to Ellensburg to reside with Braun indefinitely. She brought her personal belongings. In the coming months, Braun supplied Jane alcohol, and Jane furnished Braun sex. Jane continued to employ the pseudonym “Kathy” among Braun's acquaintances.¶14 In September 2013, Jane's monogamous sexual relationship with Lars Braun shifted. Braun expressed his desire for group sex for his impending birthday. Although Jane did not relish the idea of a quartet of bodies, she employed the Internet to procure an encounter with an Ephrata couple. When Braun and Jane met the couple in their Ephrata home, Braun pressured the woman to kiss and touch Jane. The woman refused [***8]  because of Jane's reticence. Though the foursome engaged in sexual intercourse, the lethargic Braun quickly retired to the couch to nap, while Jane continued the assignation with the couple. Braun later told Jane that she failed him because of the unattractive, advancing age of the Ephrata woman. Braun's comment saddened Jane.¶15 Lars Braun told Jane that the two should locate other individuals for group sex. Jane unearthed another man-woman couple in Yakima. When the four met, Braun directed Jane to please the man as he watched. During Jane's encounter with the male, the male grew aggressive. Despite Jane's plea to Braun to stay near, he retreated with the woman to another room.¶16 Jane and Lars Braun resided together in Ellensburg from late June to December 2013. During these six months, Jane relied exclusively on Braun for food and housing. Braun supplied Jane mass quantities of alcohol.¶17 In December 2013, Lars Braun moved to Florida without Jane. Braun never told Jane the reason behind his cross-continent move. Jane returned to Spokane and resided again with her parents. She missed and wanted the [*764]  company of beau Braun. While in Florida, Braun lived with his friend, Susan.¶18 Lars Braun and Jane [***9]  distantly communicated. Braun began entreating Jane to post Craigslist ads for sex. Jane minded Braun. An individual responded to one advertisement and offered Jane money for sex. The offer of remuneration surprised Jane. She asked Braun why somebody would pay money for sex. In response, Braun encouraged Jane to market sexual performances for money. Braun spoke of dating a prostitute as tantalizing. Braun explained to Jane that he would grow bored of their exclusive relationship without the thrill of other sexual partners. He threatened to cheat on Jane if she refused to prostitute herself. Conversely, he promised to love and cherish till death do them part if Jane fulfilled his directions to sell her body.¶19 Jane engaged in sexual liaisons with those that responded to her Craigslist postings while Lars Braun resided in Florida. Lars Braun reviewed the communications between Jane and the respondents to her ads. He instructed her on the amount to charge, which sum depended on the duration of the encounter and the nature of the act.¶20 On one occasion, Lars Braun requested that Jane send him a photograph of herself with the john. She humored Braun and sent a photograph. On reviewing the photo, [***10]  an incensed Braun scolded Jane for appearing to enjoy the assignation.¶21 In June 2014, Jane moved to Florida to reside with Lars Braun, who continued to live with Susan. Susan soon expelled Braun and Jane from her home. For two weeks, the reunified couple then slept on an air mattress in the outdoors. Braun found employment at a pizzeria. His boss allowed him and, by extension, Jane to sleep at the restaurant. In the daytime when Braun did not work, the couple resigned to Braun's vehicle. After residing in the pizza parlor, Lars Braun and Jane 20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *762; 502 P.3d 884, **888; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***6Page 4 of 18 next dwelled in a motel. [*765] ¶22 While reunited in Florida, Lars Braun and Jane abused alcohol, which led to verbal and physical altercations. After fighting with Braun on one occasion, Jane exited Braun's vehicle and walked along the street. Police approached her. A woozy Jane yelled at the officers. The officers detained Jane and placed her in jail. [**890] ¶23 On Jane's release from jail, Lars Braun drove her to their motel room. Jane retired to bed early that evening because of her employment with Panera Bread. Her job duties required her to open the bakery at 6:00 a.m. Braun shook Jane and called her vulgar names as she attempted to slumber. Braun grabbed Jane by her [***11]  throat and straddled her. As Braun strangled Jane, he slowly released phlegm and spittle into her face. Jane constantly feared Braun thereafter.¶24 On a later occasion, while Jane and Lars Braun argued, Braun smashed Jane's Nintendo Wii against the ground. The destruction of the game console aggravated Jane because she lacked possessions and her parents had purchased the Wii for her as a gift. An altercation ensued, and law enforcement arrived to expel the couple from the motel room. Braun pestered Jane while she packed her belongings, which act prompted officers to threaten him with jail. Police ordered Braun to stay away from Jane's place of work. On an ensuing day, Braun disregarded the officers' demand and approached Jane as she left work. Jane entered Braun's vehicle.¶25 While in Florida, Jane twice left the company of Lars Braun. She returned each time.¶26 We move forward to the summer of 2015. During this time while still in Florida, Lars Braun directed Jane to dress in provocative outfits. The duo would cruise bars, where Braun asked men to come home with him and have sex with Jane. Braun did not always ask men for money in exchange for the sex. Sometimes, he procured men to fornicate [***12]  with Jane for his enjoyment and thrill.¶27  [*766] Jane insists that she never wished to prostitute herself. She believed that her sexual performances with others, however, gratified Braun. During trial, when asked by the prosecution whether she believed she had a choice to participate in the sexual encounters, Jane responded no. When asked about her claimed lack of choice, Jane testified:Because he—he would still—he would—I was gonna suffer. He would—he would ignore me or still try to have sex with women and do that and have me do things I didn't want to do. And I never ever felt like I could say no. And if I did say no, it certainly wasn't going to be respected.Report of Proceedings (RP) at 219.¶28 When sober, Jane told Lars Braun that she could not engage in sex for money. Braun then provided Jane with alcohol and drugs. He also promised to participate in the sexual acts with her. While under the influence, Jane relented to engage in sex with others. Braun rarely kept his promise to partake in the encounter, however. The money gained from Jane's tricks paid for motel stays, fuel, and alcohol.¶29 For awhile in Florida, Lars Braun and Jane stayed in separate motel rooms because of their constant quarreling. On one evening, Braun, wanting [***13]  to reconcile with Jane, invited her to join in sex. Jane agreed. While the two entangled in bed, Braun announced his intent to anally penetrate Jane. Jane told him no. Nevertheless, Braun forcibly penetrated Jane's anus. The anal incursion hurt Jane. She could not sit for days.¶30 One evening while the couple rested in a Florida motel, Jane informed Lars Braun that she intended to call her parents on the phone provided in their room, since her cell phone had broken. Jane intended to notify her parents about Braun's forcing her to engage in sexual relations with strangers for money. Braun reacted by yanking the phone cord from the wall. Jane threw the phone at Braun, who bled from the impact with the phone. Jane worried that [*767]  Braun would hit her in retaliation. Braun told Jane that, if he was a woman and she a man, law enforcement would jail her for her conduct. Braun's comment horrified a repentant Jane, who employed the motel lobby phone to report, to law enforcement, her assaultive behavior. She also struck herself in the nose with a beer bottle to demonstrate her remorse to Braun. Law enforcement journeyed to the motel and arrested Jane.¶31 Jane spent thirty-five days in a Florida jail for [***14]  assaulting Lars Braun. The Florida court issued a no-contact order between the two. Apparently Florida correction officers do not enforce no-contact orders, because Braun twice visited Jane in jail. During his first visit, Braun voiced his everlasting  [**891]  love for Jane. On the second visit, Braun reported that he 20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *764; 502 P.3d 884, **889; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***10Page 5 of 18 had been fired from his job and intended to return to Ellensburg. Braun asked Jane to call him on her release from jail.¶32 While Jane resided in the Florida jail, motel staff disposed of all of Jane's belongings, including her Social Security card. Jane believes that Lars Braun permitted staff to discard her possessions. After release from incarceration in July 2015, Jane journeyed by bus to Spokane. Once in Spokane, Jane's father drove her to Ellensburg to reunite with Braun.¶33 In Ellensburg, Lars Braun and Jane stayed at Bill Thulean's house. Both Braun and Jane then engaged in recreational methamphetamine use. Before leaving Florida, Jane had used methamphetamine one time. While in Ellensburg, Jane became addicted to the controlled substance. She relied on Braun for access to the drug. Braun's primary source was Thulean. Braun commenced referring to Jane as his “‘little meth whore’” [***15]  and parceled drugs to her if she performed sexually the way he desired. RP at 146.¶34 Jane's prostitution continued in Ellensburg. Lars Braun dictated the clothes and makeup that Jane wore. Braun allowed Jane to keep twenty percent of the money she earned from her services, but he otherwise kept all [*768]  money earned. Jane's twenty percent of the earnings went to refining her looks and to the couple's food. Braun did not permit Jane her own phone.¶35 Lars Braun dictated the length and nature of Jane's profitable sexual activity. If the rendezvous lasted longer than planned, Braun punished Jane by arranging encounters with violent johns. Braun would also shun Jane for days. If Braun concluded that Jane immensely enjoyed herself during a sexual encounter, he punished her by insisting on sex with him immediately thereafter.¶36 Lars Braun sometimes arranged sexual encounters for Jane without her knowledge and while using her e-mail account. He misrepresented to Jane the nature of upcoming trysts. Braun numbered the quantity of men with which Jane engaged in sex. Periodically he announced the number to Jane, while labeling her a slut.¶37 Lars Braun nicknamed Jane “whore,” “‘little floozy,’” [***16]  and “‘F toy.’” RP at 243. Acquaintances referred to Jane as Braun's property, and men asked, in Braun's presence, for the services of Jane. Braun informed Jane that, despite his loving devotion to her, no one else liked her because of her loose morals. Braun constantly told Jane that the only valuable asset she had to offer to the world was her body. Braun isolated Jane from her parents by insulting them to Jane and telling Jane that her parents were ashamed of her and wanted no contact with her. Braun insisted that Jane owed him sexual favors because of her infidelities with others.¶38 Lars Braun once drew a bucket with sperm dripping into the bucket. He labeled the bucket with Jane's name. A confused Jane interpreted the amount of detail Braun drew on the dribbling picture as displaying his love for her.¶39 Sometimes Lars Braun promised Jane that, if she did as requested, he would marry her, have children with her, and start a family with her. Jane desperately wanted children. Once Lars Braun told Jane that, if she obeyed him [*769]  one last time, he would not demand she perform sex with another again. The promise went unfulfilled.¶40 Although many of Jane's sexual encounters resulted in monetary payment, [***17]  Lars Braun arranged for some rendezvouses in exchange for other goods and services. Lars Braun allowed Bill Thulean to periodically fornicate with Jane in exchange for drugs. Jane once trysted with a man in exchange for access to a shower. On another occasion, Jane netted the duo a temporary residence with her services. At the arrangement of Braun, Jane performed sexual turns for cigarettes and chewing tobacco. Jane once had intercourse with a man in exchange for Braun engaging in sex with the man's wife. When Braun's boss caught him stealing money from work, the employer agreed to withhold calling law enforcement in exchange for sexual encounters with Jane. [**892] ¶41 Some of Jane's sexual encounters caused her pain or placed her in danger. When Jane complained to Lars Braun about pain from her sexual assignations, Braun would disburse unlawful medication to her. Jane then felt loved.¶42 Lars Braun once left Jane alone with a man after Braun tied her to a tree. She pleaded with Braun not to leave her alone with the john. Braun left for over an hour while he ate at a Taco Bell restaurant. On another occasion, while Jane lay roped to a bed, a man sharpened his machete nearby. When performing fellatio [***18]  on another man, Jane could not breathe. The man's penis penetrated her throat far enough to choke her. She vomited and needed to swallow her 20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *767; 502 P.3d 884, **891; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***14Page 6 of 18 vomit while the male continued to orally penetrate her, despite her striving for his attention by tapping him from behind and kicking her legs.¶43 Lars Braun and Jane referred to one john as “‘Trailer Guy.’” CP at 266. When angry at Jane, Braun occasionally threatened her: “‘trailer guy is coming over.’” CP at 266. On one day, Braun scheduled a tryst at a hotel with Trailer Guy because of Braun's ire, and Jane begged Braun not to leave the hotel room because of the john's past history of injuring her during their sexual encounters. Braun, [*770]  nonetheless, left Jane alone in the hotel with the man he knew would hurt her physically.¶44 On another occasion, Lars Braun arranged for Jane to trick with two men in exchange for money to repair his truck. The second man in the pair violently held Jane's head down on the bed. Braun knocked on the door. Jane yelled that she was unable to stand. The man ejaculated and then released Jane's head. A bleeding Jane rose and opened the room door for Braun. She went to the bathroom to rest from the pain. Braun followed her, [***19]  stroked Jane, and announced: “‘Now it's my turn.’” CP at 267. When Jane did not respond, he angrily shouted: “You just F'd them and you're not even paying any attention to me.” CP at 267. She told him that she was hurt and bleeding. She knew, however, that, despite her pain, pleasing Braun held first priority.¶45 On one occasion, Jane bled because of a rough rendezvous. Lars Braun, despite Jane's moans from pain, insisted on sex with her that night.¶46 At an unidentified time, Lars Braun posted an advertisement on Craigslist for sex with two women, Jane and another girlfriend of Braun's. The advertisement included the acronym BOGO, shorthand for “buy one, get one free.” Jane met the other woman and concluded that the lady suffered a developmental disability. She expressed to Bill Thulean and Braun the unseemliness of employing the lady as a prostitute. The two men laughed in response. Jane and the second woman engaged in two encounters with men. Braun also directed the lady to have oral sex with him and with Thulean.¶47 Jane sometimes engaged in consensual bondage with Lars Braun. He liked to tie her to a bed. Braun permitted others to enter the room and see Jane naked while she was restrained.¶48 During [***20]  the pair's stay in Ellensburg in 2015-16, police occasionally responded to vociferous arguments between the two. Because of the presence of illegal drugs in [*771]  her vicinity, Jane each time refrained from informing law enforcement about Braun's use and abuse of her. One day in Ellensburg, during a time when the couple occupied Lars Braun's truck, Braun slapped Jane in the face. The police responded. Jane asked law enforcement not to press charges, however, because all of her belongings were in Braun's truck. She feared Braun's fury if authorities arrested him.¶49 In 2017, Lars Braun and Jane resided in Braun's deceased father's Colfax home. Braun continued to require Jane to perform sex with others, but now without pay. The sex was only for Braun's titillation. Jane still believed she had no choice but to obey. ¶50 During the time in Colfax, Jane, as the result of methamphetamine use, became emaciated and decreased to ninety pounds. She suffered from bladder infections and thinning hair. Jane experienced multiple seizures. Nonetheless, Braun continued to schedule sexual encounters for her. The couple received methamphetamine in return.  [**893]  Braun occasionally tied Jane to the bed and allowed his son [***21]  to view her naked.¶51 While the couple resided in Colfax, the pair traveled to the Carolinas, where Lars Braun bought a vehicle with money he had inherited from his father. While returning to Washington State with the purchased vehicle and at an unidentified location, Jane suffered a seizure. A nurse, who fortuitously witnessed the convulsion, directed Jane to the nearest hospital. While in the hospital lobby, Jane experienced another seizure, was taken to the emergency room, and was admitted to neurology for observation. After twenty-four hours, Jane departed from the hospital, and the couple resumed their journey to Colfax.¶52 During the same transcontinental journey, while the two traveled in New Mexico, Lars Braun received news that his son had died by drug overdose. The couple spent that night in a New Mexico hotel and planned to travel directly to Pullman the next day for the son's funeral. When Jane [*772]  awoke the next morning, she felt dizzy, could barely walk, and noticed a large blister on her face. Jane ambulated to the hotel lobby, asked the desk clerk to summon an ambulance, and collapsed on a sofa.¶53 New Mexico emergency responders ferried Jane to a hospital, where medical staff performed blood [***22]  work. A physician diagnosed Jane with Stevens-20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *769; 502 P.3d 884, **892; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***18Page 7 of 18 Johnson syndrome as a result of an adverse reaction to her phenytoin, an antiseizure medication. Stevens-Johnson causes the epidermis, the top layer of the skin, to die and separate. The hospital airlifted Jane to an Amarillo hospital for further treatment. Lars Braun continued on his journey to Pullman for his son's funeral. Four days later, Jane's parents retrieved her from the Texas panhandle and drove her to their Spokane home. Her mother described her appearance as that of a cancer patient.¶54 On the day Jane returned to Spokane in April 2017, Lars Braun texted her to inform her that he had garnered methamphetamine. The two rendezvoused in a Spokane hotel room and got high on meth. While together in the room, Jane spied Braun's phone and discovered that he had been messaging a prostitute in Lewiston. Jane then recognized her triviality to Braun. With this epiphany, she ended her relationship with Braun and returned to her parents.¶55 Lars Braun continued to text Jane. He pleaded with her to visit him and promised he would dispense drugs for her. Braun offered to return Jane's personal possessions to her if she met him alone. Jane refused. [***23]  Lars Braun e-mailed Jane's mother. He wrote the mother that, if Jane reported his conduct to anyone, Braun would inform others of the number of people with whom Jane had sex. Braun continued with unreturned texting to Jane until January 2018.\""

       "'Facts and Procedural HistoryA Madison County grand jury indicted the defendant, Randall Ray Ward, for two counts of trafficking a person for a commercial sex act (Counts one and three) and two counts of promoting prostitution (Counts two 1 It is the policy of this Court to refer to victims of sexual crimes by their initials. We intend no disrespect.Page 2 of 8and four). Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of one count of trafficking a person for a commercial sex act (Count three) and two counts of promoting prostitution (Counts two and four). The defendant was acquitted on Count one. At trial, the State presented the following facts for the jury\\'s review.T.G. testified she was a heroin addict for twenty years, and, to support her habit, she began engaging in acts of prostitution. Initially, she worked for a man named Chew. However, after a physical altercation, T.G. wanted more protection. The defendant approached her and promised to take care of her if she worked as a prostitute for him.S.C. testified she met the defendant shortly after moving to Jackson. Like T.G., S.C. was addicted [*3]  to heroin and moved to Jackson for easier access to drugs. While in Jackson, S.C.\\'s friend posted an ad for her on Backpage, a website containing advertisements for commercial sex services. Three days after her ad was posted, the defendant contacted S.C. and asked her to work for him. The defendant promised S.C. she would \"never have to be dope sick\" again. S.C. explained \"dope sick[ness]\" occurs when your body goes through heroin withdrawal.To procure clients for T.G. and S.C., the defendant took \"almost nude\" photographs of them posing suggestively. T.G. and S.C., who went by the names \"Barbie\" and \"Peaches,\" respectively, posed both alone and together. Although only the defendant took T.G.\\'s pictures, S.C. testified both the defendant and T.G. took pictures of her. The defendant then edited the pictures and used them in advertisements he posted on Backpage. The advertisements listed T.G. and S.C.\\'s location as Jackson and provided their cell phone numbers for potential clients to contact. Neither T.G. nor S.C. had the password to the defendant\\'s Backpage account and had no control over the content of the advertisements or how long they stayed on the website.While working for the [*4]  defendant, T.G. acted as his \"bottom.\" She explained that this meant she was the defendant\\'s \"right[-]hand man.\" As a \"bottom,\" T.G. had access to better quality drugs, slept in her own room, and recruited women to work in the defendant\\'s \"stables.\" Additionally, if the defendant were not present, T.G. was in charge of the other women.T.G. and S.C. testified the defendant was both physically and mentally abusive. The defendant kept all of the money they earned, and, if he believed they were not seeing enough clients, he would withhold drugs until they earned more money. T.G. estimated she saw eight to fifteen clients each day and charged $200 per hour. Although the clients paid T.G. and S.C. directly, all of the money they earned went to the defendant immediately after the client left. In addition, the defendant controlled where T.G. and S.C. slept, when they ate, and what they wore. The defendant also kept both T.G. and S.C.\\'s identification in his wallet, only relinquishing them when they were needed to rent a hotel room. However, after the room was paid for, the defendant immediately regained control of the ID.If T.G. refused to perform a sexual act with a client, the defendant [*5]  would threaten her, asking why she was \"going to make [him] kill [her].\" The defendant also threatened to abandon T.G. with \"just the shirt on [her] back.\" Although she wanted to leave, T.G.\\'s drug addiction acted like \"invisible handcuffs,\" preventing her from escaping the defendant\\'s grasp. However, shortly before the defendant\\'s arrest, T.G. attempted to escape while the defendant was asleep. As she was running from the hotel, the defendant chased her, pulled her hair, and \"threw [her] around.\"S.C. testified she was not forced to see particular clients as long as she \"made up the money . . . another way.\" When asked if she were able to come and go as she pleased, S.C. stated she \"never really tested that theory\" because she was afraid of what the defendant would do to her. Once, the defendant was physically violent with S.C. to \"prove . . . he was in control.\" Another time, S.C. saw the defendant hit T.G., resulting in a \"big knot on her head\" and bruises.On June 14, 2017, T.G., S.C., the defendant, and another woman travelled from Jackson to Memphis to meet clients. After checking into a hotel, S.C. and the other woman overdosed on heroin. Although S.C. recovered from her overdose, [*6]  T.G. took the other woman to the hospital. Officers from the Bartlett Police Department arrived at the hospital to investigate the overdose, and T.G. was taken into custody. However, T.G. did not initially disclose her relationship with the defendant because she was only concerned with \"getting that next lick of dope.\" Likewise, when initially questioned, S.C. did not reveal her connection with the defendant. However, after she was arrested in Madison County two weeks later, S.C. spoke to Special Agent Chris Carpenter with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and disclosed that she was working as a prostitute for the defendant.On cross-examination, T.G. acknowledged having perks 2020 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 152, *2Page 3 of 8as a result of being the defendant\\'s \"bottom,\" including additional freedom and her own cell phone, and she agreed she never reached out to family or friends for help. T.G. also acknowledged she sometimes used physical violence or threats to control the other women when the defendant was not present. Although she was initially charged with the same offenses as the defendant, the charges were dropped after she agreed to cooperate with police.On cross-examination, S.C. agreed she did not reveal that the defendant [*7]  was physically violent until the second time she spoke with Special Agent Carpenter and acknowledged she was allowed to attend rehab shortly after giving the police her statement. S.C. also agreed she was allowed to get food without the defendant but testified T.G. was always with her if the defendant was not present.Detective Mike Christian with the Bartlett Police Department responded to a report of an overdose at a local hospital on June 14, 2017. After speaking with T.G., Detective Christian obtained a search warrant for the defendant\\'s hotel room and instructed fellow detectives to arrest the defendant. Detective Christian searched the defendant\\'s hotel room, finding a number of cell phones, a laptop computer, and various documents. Following the defendant\\'s arrest, Detective Christian seized the defendant\\'s wallet and a Samsung Galaxy cellphone. In the defendant\\'s wallet, Detective Christian discovered S.C.\\'s state-issued ID and a handwritten note which read \"I, [S.G.], give my human rights up to my daddy, T-Bone, for the rest of forever as long as we continue showing our mutual respect forever.\" S.C. admitted writing the note but testified it was as a joke. She stated the note [*8]  was a gift for the defendant because she wanted to do \"something nice for him.\"Lieutenant Jerry Springer with the Bartlett Police Department conducted an examination of the Samsung Galaxy cell phone found on the defendant at the time of his arrest. During the examination, Lieutenant Springer extracted videos, photographs, text messages, and phone logs. In particular, the phone contained scantily clad pictures of T.G. and S.C. with the names \"Barbie\" and \"Peaches\" superimposed on them. Lieutenant Springer also recovered several photographs of the defendant with T.G. and S.C..The defendant declined to present evidence. Following deliberations, the jury found the defendant guilty of promoting prostitution with regard to his actions against T.G. (Count two) and trafficking a person for a commercial sex act and promoting prostitution with regard to his actions against S.C. (Counts three and four). The defendant was found not guilty of trafficking a person for a commercial sex act with regards to T.G. (Count one). Following a sentencing hearing, the trial court imposed an effective sentence of twenty years.The defendant filed a timely motion for new trial in which he argued, in part, the [*9]  evidence at trial was insufficient to support the jury\\'s verdict and the trial court erred in refusing to give an accomplice jury instruction and in refusing to merge Counts three and four. The trial court denied the motion, and this timely appeal followed.'"
