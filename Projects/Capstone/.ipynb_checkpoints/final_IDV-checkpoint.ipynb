On March 8, 2017, the Court sentenced  Petitioner to 188 months\\' imprisonment following his plea of guilty to one count of sex trafficking of a minor, in  violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1) and (b)(2). Petitioner\\'s appeal is currently pending before the Second Circuit.  See Second Circuit Docket No. 17-822. \"[T]here is no jurisdictional bar to a district court\\'s adjudication of a § 2255 motion during the pendency of a direct  appeal.\" United States v. Outen, 286 F.3d 622, 632 (2d Cir. 2002) (emphasis omitted). However, \"district courts in  this Circuit have generally denied without prejudice as premature those § 2255 motions that are filed during the  pendency of a direct appeal.\" Rivera v.

This practice arises out of  considerations \"of judicial economy and the concern that the results on direct appeal may make the district court\\'s  efforts on [*2]  the § 2255 motion a nullity.\" Outen, 286 F.3d at 632. See also Womack v. United States, 395 F.2d  630, 631, 129 U.S. App. D.C. 407 (D.C. Cir. 1968) (\"We are of the view that there is no jurisdictional bar to the  District Court\\'s entertaining a Section 2255 motion during the pendency of a direct appeal but that the orderly  administration of criminal law precludes considering such a motion absent extraordinary circumstances.\"); 1976  Advisory Committee Note to Rule 5 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings for the United States District  Page 2 of 2   Courts (\"There is no requirement that the movant exhaust his remedies prior to seeking relief under § 2255.  However, the courts have held that such a motion is inappropriate if the movant is simultaneously appealing the  decision.\") (citing Womack, supra). Petitioner states that he filed his § 2255 motion before exhausting his appellate remedies because he is actually  innocent, and because his appellate counsel filed an Anders brief. These arguments do not rise to the level of  \"extraordinary circumstance[s]\" that might justify resolving Petitioner\\'s § 2255 motion now, particularly in light of the  fact that an actual innocence claim is \"demanding and permits review only in the extraordinary case.\" House v. Bell,  547 U.S. 518, 538, 126 S. Ct. 2064, 165 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2006) (quotation marks omitted). Petitioner\\'s § 2255 motion (Docket No. 113) is therefore denied without prejudice. Petitioner may still file a § 2255  motion once his conviction becomes final. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1) and Rule 11(a) of the Rules  Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, the [*3]  Court declines to issue a certificate of appealability because  Petitioner has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. Finally, the Court certifies,  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(3), that any appeal taken from this decision would not be taken in good faith. Thus,  leave to appeal in forma pauperis is denied. Petitioner is nonetheless advised that, should he decide to appeal this  Decision and Order, \"Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a) governs the time to appeal,\" and \"[a] timely notice of  appeal must be filed even\" though the Court declined to issue a certificate of appealability.

       "\"                                                  ¶1  [*759]  [**887] F, J. — [S]ex traffickers select victims who demonstrate  vulnerabilities including homelessness, substance  abuse, mental health issues, and histories of  physical, emotional or sexual abuse. A typical  trafficker recruits victims by telling them that he  loves them, promising them a better life, providing  them with shelter and drugs, and lying to them  about the nature of the job. … … . [T]raffickers control their victims through physical  violence, sexual violence, psychological violence  and grooming. Traffickers … groom victims with  promises and compliments, but escalate to physical  abuse, sexual assault and death threats. … They  also use psychological violence such as tearing a  victim [***2]  down, telling them they are worthless,  socially isolating them, and controlling them  financially and by taking advantage of a victim's  drug dependency. … … [V]ictims often stay with their traffickers—or  leave and then return—because they believe they  have nowhere to go; that there is no one else out  there for them, and no other options for them; they  feel ashamed and guilty and stigmatized, thinking  that they will not be accepted elsewhere. They are  also afraid that if they leave, the trafficker will find  them and harm them even more egregiously.  Testimony of Sharon Cooper in United States v.  Carson, 870 F.3d 584, 590-91 (7th Cir. 2017). Page 2 of 18   ¶2 Appellant Lars Braun appeals his convictions, after a  bench trial, for human trafficking and promoting  prostitution [*760] . Because overwhelming evidence  supports a finding that his victim engaged in prostitution  as the result of Braun's manipulation, we affirm both  convictions. We also reject Braun's contention that the  trial court violated the appearance of fairness doctrine.  We grant Braun's request for resentencing because his  offender score included an earlier conviction for  possessing a controlled substance. FACTS ¶3 This prosecution arises from the protracted,  poignant,  and  pungent  relationship  between  Jane, [***3]  a pseudonym, and defendant Lars Braun.  The four-year relationship included the performance of  commercial sex acts by Jane at the request of and for  the financial gain and sexual enchantment of Braun.  Braun's appeal raises two principal questions: First,  whether Braun, within the meaning of Washington's  human trafficking statute, meted “force, coercion, and  fraud” against Jane in fulfillment of one of the crime's  elements? Second, whether the force, coercion, or fraud  led to Jane's prostitution in satisfaction of a second  element of the crime? Answers to these questions  require a review of the language, intent, and history  behind RCW 9A.40.100, Washington's trafficking  statute. Answering the questions also necessitates a  narrative of Jane's remarkable story, remarkable not  because of its singularity or the tragedy portrayed but  because of the prevalence, yet hidden nature, of  trafficking and because of the story's example of how  enduring manipulation can implausibly result in the  control of another's choices, even to the extent of  causing the other to perform repulsive and dangerous  acts. We  [**888]  glean the appeal's facts primarily from  the trial testimony of Jane. ¶4 In February 2013, Jane began communicating [***4]   with Lars Braun over the Internet. Jane was then twenty  years old and married. Braun was in his early fifties and  also married. Jane lived in Spokane, and Braun resided  in Ellensburg. Jane knew Braun's children through her  husband,  [*761]  who socialized with the offspring. In  her cyber messages to Braun, Jane expressed concern  about the methamphetamine intake of Braun's children. ¶5 At the same time that Jane started writing Lars  Braun, she commenced abusing alcohol. Her alcohol  use created conflict in her marriage. ¶6 By April 2013, Lars Braun and Jane spoke by phone  or communicated by e-mail several hours each day.  Jane then admired Braun, thirty years her senior, as an  accomplished intellectual. Jane divulged her marital  problems. Braun advised Jane to engage in an  extramarital affair. Braun expounded that he rekindled  his marriage by cheating on his wife. ¶7 In May 2013, Lars Braun and Jane met in person for  the first time and interlocked in sexual intercourse inside  a Spokane hotel room. By May, Braun and his wife were  in the process of divorce. Jane's husband soon learned  of her carnal encounter with Braun. Jane moved from  her husband's residence and divorced him. ¶8 Lars Braun learned that Jane informed [***5]  Jane's  husband of her sexual encounter with Braun. Braun  grew furious at Jane because he worried that his wife  would also hear about the affair and use the tryst  against him in their divorce and child custody  proceeding. Braun ceased speaking with Jane. ¶9 Alas, the lack of interaction between Lars Braun and  Jane did not last. While Jane engaged in intimate  relations with another man, Braun called Jane. We do  not know why Jane answered the phone during this  rendezvous. During the telephone conversation, Braun  screamed at Jane. Braun called Jane “‘slut.’” Clerk's  Papers (CP) at 253-54. Braun's clamorous comments  suggested to Jane that Braun was jealous. The remarks  also surprised Jane since Braun had told her he would  never speak to her again. Braun and Jane spoke by  phone on additional occasions in the coming days. Jane  repeatedly apologized to Braun. Braun revealed to Jane  she was his girlfriend.  [*762]  ¶10 In early June 2013, Lars Braun invited Jane to visit  him in Ellensburg, where he would introduce her to his  friends. Jane lacked a driver's license. So Jane traveled  by bus from Spokane to Ellensburg to visit Braun. Braun  there purchased alcohol for Jane, since she remained  below the legal age [***6]  to purchase liquor. Contrary  to his telephonic enticement, Braun hid his relationship  with Jane from acquaintances in Ellensburg. He directed  her to use the name “Kathy,” and he informed others  that “Kathy” and he shared a platonic relationship.  During the first visit, Braun permitted his seven-year-old  son to enter the bed where Braun and Jane lay naked. ¶11 Dave, with an unidentified last name, also resided  with Lars Braun in Ellensburg during Jane's early June  2013 visit. On one day, Braun left Jane alone with Dave,  during which time Dave groped Jane. Dave informed  Jane that Braun gave him permission to have sex with  her. Jane refused Dave's overture, after which Dave  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *759; 502 P.3d 884, **887; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***2 Page 3 of 18   punched the bed by her head. Jane ran into and locked  herself in a bathroom, while crying hysterically. She  texted Braun and requested he return to the residence.  Braun declined. When Braun eventually returned home,  he accused Jane of promoting the advance by Dave  because of her suggestible behavior. Braun questioned  Jane about why she did not strike Dave if she objected  to the housemate's advance. Braun volunteered that  she encouraged Dave to engage in sex with her. He  instructed  Jane  not  to  report  Dave  to  law  enforcement. [***7]  Braun then initiated sex with Jane.  Jane never saw Dave again. ¶12 At 2:00 a.m. on the morning following Dave's sexual  assault, Lars Braun deposited Jane at the Ellensburg  Greyhound station. Braun instructed Jane to leave  Ellensburg. Jane lacked money for a ticket but, after  pleading with the bus driver, received a free ride to  Spokane.  [**889]  ¶13 After her return to Spokane, Jane resided with her  parents, but encountered difficulty living with them.  Weeks [*763]  later, Lars Braun offered to allow Jane to  live with him in Ellensburg. Late in June 2013, Jane  returned to Ellensburg to reside with Braun indefinitely.  She brought her personal belongings. In the coming  months, Braun supplied Jane alcohol, and Jane  furnished Braun sex. Jane continued to employ the  pseudonym “Kathy” among Braun's acquaintances. ¶14 In September 2013, Jane's monogamous sexual  relationship with Lars Braun shifted. Braun expressed  his desire for group sex for his impending birthday.  Although Jane did not relish the idea of a quartet of  bodies, she employed the Internet to procure an  encounter with an Ephrata couple. When Braun and  Jane met the couple in their Ephrata home, Braun  pressured the woman to kiss and touch Jane. The  woman refused [***8]  because of Jane's reticence.  Though the foursome engaged in sexual intercourse,  the lethargic Braun quickly retired to the couch to nap,  while Jane continued the assignation with the couple.  Braun later told Jane that she failed him because of the  unattractive, advancing age of the Ephrata woman.  Braun's comment saddened Jane. ¶15 Lars Braun told Jane that the two should locate  other individuals for group sex. Jane unearthed another  man-woman couple in Yakima. When the four met,  Braun directed Jane to please the man as he watched.  During Jane's encounter with the male, the male grew  aggressive. Despite Jane's plea to Braun to stay near,  he retreated with the woman to another room. ¶16 Jane and Lars Braun resided together in Ellensburg  from late June to December 2013. During these six  months, Jane relied exclusively on Braun for food and  housing. Braun supplied Jane mass quantities of  alcohol. ¶17 In December 2013, Lars Braun moved to Florida  without Jane. Braun never told Jane the reason behind  his cross-continent move. Jane returned to Spokane  and resided again with her parents. She missed and  wanted the [*764]  company of beau Braun. While in  Florida, Braun lived with his friend, Susan. ¶18  Lars  Braun  and  Jane [***9]   distantly  communicated. Braun began entreating Jane to post  Craigslist ads for sex. Jane minded Braun. An individual  responded to one advertisement and offered Jane  money for sex. The offer of remuneration surprised  Jane. She asked Braun why somebody would pay  money for sex. In response, Braun encouraged Jane to  market sexual performances for money. Braun spoke of  dating a prostitute as tantalizing. Braun explained to  Jane that he would grow bored of their exclusive  relationship without the thrill of other sexual partners. He  threatened to cheat on Jane if she refused to prostitute  herself. Conversely, he promised to love and cherish till  death do them part if Jane fulfilled his directions to sell  her body. ¶19 Jane engaged in sexual liaisons with those that  responded to her Craigslist postings while Lars Braun  resided  in  Florida.  Lars  Braun  reviewed  the  communications between Jane and the respondents to  her ads. He instructed her on the amount to charge,  which sum depended on the duration of the encounter  and the nature of the act. ¶20 On one occasion, Lars Braun requested that Jane  send him a photograph of herself with the john. She  humored Braun and sent a photograph. On reviewing  the photo, [***10]  an incensed Braun scolded Jane for  appearing to enjoy the assignation. ¶21 In June 2014, Jane moved to Florida to reside with  Lars Braun, who continued to live with Susan. Susan  soon expelled Braun and Jane from her home. For two  weeks, the reunified couple then slept on an air  mattress in the outdoors. Braun found employment at a  pizzeria. His boss allowed him and, by extension, Jane  to sleep at the restaurant. In the daytime when Braun  did not work, the couple resigned to Braun's vehicle.  After residing in the pizza parlor, Lars Braun and Jane  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *762; 502 P.3d 884, **888; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***6 Page 4 of 18   next dwelled in a motel.  [*765]  ¶22 While reunited in Florida, Lars Braun and Jane  abused alcohol, which led to verbal and physical  altercations. After fighting with Braun on one occasion,  Jane exited Braun's vehicle and walked along the street.  Police approached her. A woozy Jane yelled at the  officers. The officers detained Jane and placed her in  jail.  [**890]  ¶23 On Jane's release from jail, Lars Braun drove her to  their motel room. Jane retired to bed early that evening  because of her employment with Panera Bread. Her job  duties required her to open the bakery at 6:00 a.m.  Braun shook Jane and called her vulgar names as she  attempted to slumber. Braun grabbed Jane by  her [***11]  throat and straddled her. As Braun strangled  Jane, he slowly released phlegm and spittle into her  face. Jane constantly feared Braun thereafter. ¶24 On a later occasion, while Jane and Lars Braun  argued, Braun smashed Jane's Nintendo Wii against the  ground.  The  destruction  of  the  game  console  aggravated Jane because she lacked possessions and  her parents had purchased the Wii for her as a gift. An  altercation ensued, and law enforcement arrived to  expel the couple from the motel room. Braun pestered  Jane while she packed her belongings, which act  prompted officers to threaten him with jail. Police  ordered Braun to stay away from Jane's place of work.  On an ensuing day, Braun disregarded the officers'  demand and approached Jane as she left work. Jane  entered Braun's vehicle. ¶25 While in Florida, Jane twice left the company of  Lars Braun. She returned each time. ¶26 We move forward to the summer of 2015. During  this time while still in Florida, Lars Braun directed Jane  to dress in provocative outfits. The duo would cruise  bars, where Braun asked men to come home with him  and have sex with Jane. Braun did not always ask men  for money in exchange for the sex. Sometimes, he  procured men to fornicate [***12]  with Jane for his  enjoyment and thrill. ¶27  [*766] Jane insists that she never wished to  prostitute herself. She believed that her sexual  performances with others, however, gratified Braun.  During trial, when asked by the prosecution whether she  believed she had a choice to participate in the sexual  encounters, Jane responded no. When asked about her  claimed lack of choice, Jane testified: Because he—he would still—he would—I was  gonna suffer. He would—he would ignore me or still  try to have sex with women and do that and have  me do things I didn't want to do. And I never ever  felt like I could say no. And if I did say no, it  certainly wasn't going to be respected. Report of Proceedings (RP) at 219. ¶28 When sober, Jane told Lars Braun that she could  not engage in sex for money. Braun then provided Jane  with alcohol and drugs. He also promised to participate  in the sexual acts with her. While under the influence,  Jane relented to engage in sex with others. Braun rarely  kept his promise to partake in the encounter, however.  The money gained from Jane's tricks paid for motel  stays, fuel, and alcohol. ¶29 For awhile in Florida, Lars Braun and Jane stayed  in separate motel rooms because of their constant  quarreling. On one evening, Braun, wanting [***13]  to  reconcile with Jane, invited her to join in sex. Jane  agreed. While the two entangled in bed, Braun  announced his intent to anally penetrate Jane. Jane told  him no. Nevertheless, Braun forcibly penetrated Jane's  anus. The anal incursion hurt Jane. She could not sit for  days. ¶30 One evening while the couple rested in a Florida  motel, Jane informed Lars Braun that she intended to  call her parents on the phone provided in their room,  since her cell phone had broken. Jane intended to notify  her parents about Braun's forcing her to engage in  sexual relations with strangers for money. Braun  reacted by yanking the phone cord from the wall. Jane  threw the phone at Braun, who bled from the impact  with the phone. Jane worried that [*767]  Braun would  hit her in retaliation. Braun told Jane that, if he was a  woman and she a man, law enforcement would jail her  for her conduct. Braun's comment horrified a repentant  Jane, who employed the motel lobby phone to report, to  law enforcement, her assaultive behavior. She also  struck herself in the nose with a beer bottle to  demonstrate her remorse to Braun. Law enforcement  journeyed to the motel and arrested Jane. ¶31 Jane spent thirty-five days in a Florida jail  for [***14]  assaulting Lars Braun. The Florida court  issued a no-contact order between the two. Apparently  Florida correction officers do not enforce no-contact  orders, because Braun twice visited Jane in jail. During  his first visit, Braun voiced his everlasting  [**891]  love  for Jane. On the second visit, Braun reported that he  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *764; 502 P.3d 884, **889; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***10 Page 5 of 18   had been fired from his job and intended to return to  Ellensburg. Braun asked Jane to call him on her release  from jail. ¶32 While Jane resided in the Florida jail, motel staff  disposed of all of Jane's belongings, including her Social  Security card. Jane believes that Lars Braun permitted  staff to discard her possessions. After release from  incarceration in July 2015, Jane journeyed by bus to  Spokane. Once in Spokane, Jane's father drove her to  Ellensburg to reunite with Braun. ¶33 In Ellensburg, Lars Braun and Jane stayed at Bill  Thulean's house. Both Braun and Jane then engaged in  recreational methamphetamine use. Before leaving  Florida, Jane had used methamphetamine one time.  While in Ellensburg, Jane became addicted to the  controlled substance. She relied on Braun for access to  the drug. Braun's primary source was Thulean. Braun  commenced referring to Jane as his “‘little meth  whore’” [***15]  and parceled drugs to her if she  performed sexually the way he desired. RP at 146. ¶34 Jane's prostitution continued in Ellensburg. Lars  Braun dictated the clothes and makeup that Jane wore.  Braun allowed Jane to keep twenty percent of the  money she earned from her services, but he otherwise  kept all [*768]  money earned. Jane's twenty percent of  the earnings went to refining her looks and to the  couple's food. Braun did not permit Jane her own  phone. ¶35 Lars Braun dictated the length and nature of Jane's  profitable sexual activity. If the rendezvous lasted longer  than planned, Braun punished Jane by arranging  encounters with violent johns. Braun would also shun  Jane for days. If Braun concluded that Jane immensely  enjoyed herself during a sexual encounter, he punished  her by insisting on sex with him immediately thereafter. ¶36 Lars Braun sometimes arranged sexual encounters  for Jane without her knowledge and while using her e- mail account. He misrepresented to Jane the nature of  upcoming trysts. Braun numbered the quantity of men  with which Jane engaged in sex. Periodically he  announced the number to Jane, while labeling her a  slut. ¶37 Lars Braun nicknamed Jane “whore,” “‘little  floozy,’” [***16]  and “‘F toy.’” RP at 243. Acquaintances  referred to Jane as Braun's property, and men asked, in  Braun's presence, for the services of Jane. Braun  informed Jane that, despite his loving devotion to her,  no one else liked her because of her loose morals.  Braun constantly told Jane that the only valuable asset  she had to offer to the world was her body. Braun  isolated Jane from her parents by insulting them to Jane  and telling Jane that her parents were ashamed of her  and wanted no contact with her. Braun insisted that  Jane owed him sexual favors because of her infidelities  with others. ¶38 Lars Braun once drew a bucket with sperm dripping  into the bucket. He labeled the bucket with Jane's name.  A confused Jane interpreted the amount of detail Braun  drew on the dribbling picture as displaying his love for  her. ¶39 Sometimes Lars Braun promised Jane that, if she  did as requested, he would marry her, have children  with her, and start a family with her. Jane desperately  wanted children. Once Lars Braun told Jane that, if she  obeyed him [*769]  one last time, he would not demand  she perform sex with another again. The promise went  unfulfilled. ¶40 Although many of Jane's sexual encounters  resulted in monetary payment, [***17]  Lars Braun  arranged for some rendezvouses in exchange for other  goods and services. Lars Braun allowed Bill Thulean to  periodically fornicate with Jane in exchange for drugs.  Jane once trysted with a man in exchange for access to  a shower. On another occasion, Jane netted the duo a  temporary  residence  with  her  services.  At  the  arrangement of Braun, Jane performed sexual turns for  cigarettes and chewing tobacco. Jane once had  intercourse with a man in exchange for Braun engaging  in sex with the man's wife. When Braun's boss caught  him stealing money from work, the employer agreed to  withhold calling law enforcement in exchange for sexual  encounters with Jane.  [**892]  ¶41 Some of Jane's sexual encounters caused her pain  or placed her in danger. When Jane complained to Lars  Braun about pain from her sexual assignations, Braun  would disburse unlawful medication to her. Jane then  felt loved. ¶42 Lars Braun once left Jane alone with a man after  Braun tied her to a tree. She pleaded with Braun not to  leave her alone with the john. Braun left for over an hour  while he ate at a Taco Bell restaurant. On another  occasion, while Jane lay roped to a bed, a man  sharpened his machete nearby. When performing  fellatio [***18]  on another man, Jane could not breathe.  The man's penis penetrated her throat far enough to  choke her. She vomited and needed to swallow her  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *767; 502 P.3d 884, **891; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***14 Page 6 of 18   vomit while the male continued to orally penetrate her,  despite her striving for his attention by tapping him from  behind and kicking her legs. ¶43 Lars Braun and Jane referred to one john as  “‘Trailer Guy.’” CP at 266. When angry at Jane, Braun  occasionally threatened her: “‘trailer guy is coming  over.’” CP at 266. On one day, Braun scheduled a tryst  at a hotel with Trailer Guy because of Braun's ire, and  Jane begged Braun not to leave the hotel room because  of the john's past history of injuring her during their  sexual encounters. Braun, [*770]  nonetheless, left Jane  alone in the hotel with the man he knew would hurt her  physically. ¶44 On another occasion, Lars Braun arranged for Jane  to trick with two men in exchange for money to repair his  truck. The second man in the pair violently held Jane's  head down on the bed. Braun knocked on the door.  Jane yelled that she was unable to stand. The man  ejaculated and then released Jane's head. A bleeding  Jane rose and opened the room door for Braun. She  went to the bathroom to rest from the pain. Braun  followed her, [***19]  stroked Jane, and announced:  “‘Now it's my turn.’” CP at 267. When Jane did not  respond, he angrily shouted: “You just F'd them and  you're not even paying any attention to me.” CP at 267.  She told him that she was hurt and bleeding. She knew,  however, that, despite her pain, pleasing Braun held first  priority. ¶45 On one occasion, Jane bled because of a rough  rendezvous. Lars Braun, despite Jane's moans from  pain, insisted on sex with her that night. ¶46 At an unidentified time, Lars Braun posted an  advertisement on Craigslist for sex with two women,  Jane  and  another  girlfriend  of  Braun's.  The  advertisement included the acronym BOGO, shorthand  for “buy one, get one free.” Jane met the other woman  and concluded that the lady suffered a developmental  disability. She expressed to Bill Thulean and Braun the  unseemliness of employing the lady as a prostitute. The  two men laughed in response. Jane and the second  woman engaged in two encounters with men. Braun  also directed the lady to have oral sex with him and with  Thulean. ¶47 Jane sometimes engaged in consensual bondage  with Lars Braun. He liked to tie her to a bed. Braun  permitted others to enter the room and see Jane naked  while she was restrained. ¶48 During [***20]  the pair's stay in Ellensburg in 2015- 16,  police  occasionally  responded  to  vociferous  arguments between the two. Because of the presence  of illegal drugs in [*771]  her vicinity, Jane each time  refrained from informing law enforcement about Braun's  use and abuse of her. One day in Ellensburg, during a  time when the couple occupied Lars Braun's truck,  Braun slapped Jane in the face. The police responded.  Jane asked law enforcement not to press charges,  however, because all of her belongings were in Braun's  truck. She feared Braun's fury if authorities arrested him. ¶49 In 2017, Lars Braun and Jane resided in Braun's  deceased father's Colfax home. Braun continued to  require Jane to perform sex with others, but now without  pay. The sex was only for Braun's titillation. Jane still  believed she had no choice but to obey.  ¶50 During the time in Colfax, Jane, as the result of  methamphetamine  use,  became  emaciated  and  decreased to ninety pounds. She suffered from bladder  infections and thinning hair. Jane experienced multiple  seizures. Nonetheless, Braun continued to schedule  sexual encounters for her. The couple received  methamphetamine  in  return.   [**893]   Braun  occasionally tied Jane to the bed and allowed his  son [***21]  to view her naked. ¶51 While the couple resided in Colfax, the pair traveled  to the Carolinas, where Lars Braun bought a vehicle  with money he had inherited from his father. While  returning to Washington State with the purchased  vehicle and at an unidentified location, Jane suffered a  seizure. A nurse, who fortuitously witnessed the  convulsion, directed Jane to the nearest hospital. While  in the hospital lobby, Jane experienced another seizure,  was taken to the emergency room, and was admitted to  neurology for observation. After twenty-four hours, Jane  departed from the hospital, and the couple resumed  their journey to Colfax. ¶52 During the same transcontinental journey, while the  two traveled in New Mexico, Lars Braun received news  that his son had died by drug overdose. The couple  spent that night in a New Mexico hotel and planned to  travel directly to Pullman the next day for the son's  funeral. When Jane [*772]  awoke the next morning,  she felt dizzy, could barely walk, and noticed a large  blister on her face. Jane ambulated to the hotel lobby,  asked the desk clerk to summon an ambulance, and  collapsed on a sofa. ¶53 New Mexico emergency responders ferried Jane to  a hospital, where medical staff performed blood [***22]   work. A physician diagnosed Jane with Stevens- 20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *769; 502 P.3d 884, **892; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***18 Page 7 of 18   Johnson syndrome as a result of an adverse reaction to  her phenytoin, an antiseizure medication. Stevens- Johnson causes the epidermis, the top layer of the skin,  to die and separate. The hospital airlifted Jane to an  Amarillo hospital for further treatment. Lars Braun  continued on his journey to Pullman for his son's  funeral. Four days later, Jane's parents retrieved her  from the Texas panhandle and drove her to their  Spokane home. Her mother described her appearance  as that of a cancer patient. ¶54 On the day Jane returned to Spokane in April 2017,  Lars Braun texted her to inform her that he had  garnered methamphetamine. The two rendezvoused in  a Spokane hotel room and got high on meth. While  together in the room, Jane spied Braun's phone and  discovered that he had been messaging a prostitute in  Lewiston. Jane then recognized her triviality to Braun.  With this epiphany, she ended her relationship with  Braun and returned to her parents. ¶55 Lars Braun continued to text Jane. He pleaded with  her to visit him and promised he would dispense drugs  for her. Braun offered to return Jane's personal  possessions to her if she met him alone. Jane  refused. [***23]  Lars Braun e-mailed Jane's mother. He  wrote the mother that, if Jane reported his conduct to  anyone, Braun would inform others of the number of  people with whom Jane had sex. Braun continued with  unreturned texting to Jane until January 2018. PROCEDURE ¶56 The State of Washington charged Lars Braun with  one count each of human trafficking in the first  degree, [*773]  human trafficking in the second  degree, promoting prostitution in the first degree, and  promoting prostitution in the second degree. The State  alleged that Braun committed all four crimes in  Washington State between July 1, 2015 and April 3,  2017. ¶57 Before trial, Lars Braun moved the trial court to  dismiss the human trafficking charges. Braun argued  that his alleged conduct did not amount to “force, fraud,  or coercion,” an element of Washington's trafficking  statute, RCW 9A.40.100. The trial court denied the  motion. In so ruling, the court reasoned that the word  “force,” as used in the statute, included nonphysical  force such as psychological pressure. Because RCW  9A.40.100 does not define “force,” the trial court used  one of many dictionary definitions to demarcate the  word. ¶58 On June 8, 2020, during a pretrial hearing, the  superior  court  judge  commented  about  Washington [***24]   Governor  Jay  Inslee's  order  regarding COVID-19 and the judge's own mask-wearing  policy: You're [everyone in the courtroom] certainly free  to wear a mask in here. It's encouraged by  everyone. Please feel free. … But, I'm not requiring  people, adults, to comply with the governor's order  [regarding  [**894]  masks]. It's not my order to  enforce. But certainly it's a good idea. RP at 50. ¶59 During the June 8, 2020 hearing, the State  requested a continuance due to Seattle Police Detective  Maurice Washington's unavailability to testify as a  human trafficking expert. The State informed the court  that, due to riots in Seattle over George Floyd's death,  Detective Washington's superior ordered him to remain  in Seattle. The trial court denied the State's continuance  motion. In return, Lars Braun motioned for the exclusion  of Detective Maurice Washington's testimony rather  than allow him to testify remotely. The court reserved  ruling on Braun's motion. ¶60  [*774] On June 11, 2020, the case proceeded to a  bench trial. At the beginning of trial, the trial judge  reiterated his mask-wearing policy: My policy is—is slightly different than the  governor's policy. He wants everybody who is  indoors to be wearing a mask at all [***25]  times.  Even if they sit—sit—social distancing guidelines  are met. I think adults are able to run their own  lives, and so I'll let you folks decide how you want  to do it in this courtroom. RP at 67-68. Near the close of the State's case, the trial  court granted Lars Braun's motion to exclude Detective  Maurice Washington's testimony regarding human  trafficking. ¶61 Before the superior court judge delivered its  decision, the judge commented about COVID-19 and  pandemics in general: The world is sure in a turmoil right now, isn't it,  with Covid 19, with the unprecedented—which  means “never happened before”, not in my lifetime,  not in the lifetime of my parents, who are both in  their 80s. Theoretically it happened in 1917. We  don't really know because the newspaper reporting  back then was somewhat sensationalized; similar to  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *772; 502 P.3d 884, **893; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***22 Page 8 of 18   today. But the public health response to that crises  was different than this one. RP at 295. The judge also mentioned the uncertainty in  the judicial system resulting from the perceived  pandemic: Thus, we're here. We're doing a bench trial for  Mr. Braun, not a jury trial, because we can't say  when we're going to have the ability to bring jurors  back  into  the  courthouse.  Wow.  Wow.  Uncertainty. [***26]  RP at 295-96. ¶62 Before rendering his decision, the superior court  judge discussed the George Floyd protests occurring in  Seattle in May and June 2020: This very case is touched by another crisis that's  going on 105 miles away from here in Seattle right  this very minute. There are blocks, city blocks, of  the largest city in our State that [*775]  are in  anarchy. There is no law. Or perhaps there is law;  it's just not the law that we're used to. Someone  else is deciding what the law is, not us, as the  people who are in charge of the sovereign. So I've  been thinking about these things a lot. RP at 296 (emphasis added). We have blocks and blocks in Seattle this  second that caused it so a witness couldn't come to  this trial because he's a police officer and he can't  break away to come down here. He's got—he's got  to police the City of Seattle. And it's not going so  well if people don't want to follow the rules.  Psychologically. Right? RP at 298 (emphasis added). ¶63 The trial court found Lars Braun guilty of human  trafficking in the first degree and promoting prostitution  in the first degree. The court acquitted Braun of the  lesser included offenses of second degree human  trafficking and second degree promoting prostitution. ¶64 The trial court [***27]  entered findings of fact and  conclusions of law. Lars Braun does not challenge any  of the findings of fact. We, however, quote those  findings relevant to his use of force and his forceful  conduct causing Jane to engage in sexual acts. We  repeat some of the facts already written because Braun  contends the findings do not support his conviction for  human trafficking and we wish to meet this contention. ¶65 The trial court found, among other facts:  [**895] While living in Florida, they [Lars Braun  and Jane] … had several violent encounters where  the police were called. CP at 257. While drunk, the defendant … on one occasion  strangulat[ed] her [Jane]. While he was on top of  her, he spit phlegm and saliva all over her face,  refusing to let her sleep, every time she would fall  asleep, he would wake her up, even though she  had to be at work at 4 a.m. the next morning. From  this point [*776]  forward, she was afraid of the  defendant, this event always in her mind. CP at 258. On one occasion in Florida when they were  fighting, he told her he was going to “F-[her] in the  ass right [there].” She told him no, but he forced his  penis into her anus with no lubrication. It was very  painful for her. CP at 258 (alterations in original). One [***28]  time in their truck in Ellensburg, he  slapped her in the [face] … . CP at 261. There were particular Johns who were mean to  the victim, including one they referred to as “Trailer  Guy,” and he [Lars Braun] would threaten her  [Jane] by saying, “trailer guy is coming over,” if he  [Braun] were [sic] angry at her. One time he  arranged a meeting at a hotel with trailer guy  because he was angry at [Jane] and she begged  him not to leave the hotel room because she was  afraid of how Trailer Guy always physically hurt her  during their sexual encounters, but the defendant  left her alone in the hotel with the man he knew  would hurt her physically. CP at 266. The victim [Jane] became completely dependent  upon the defendant. All of her belongings were in  his truck. She did not drive. She felt that she had no  choice but to do what he wanted, if she did not, she  would suffer. CP at 266. On one occasion, the defendant arranged for  [Jane] to have sex with two men in exchange for  money to repair their truck. The defendant told her  she had to do it because they needed the money to  fix the truck. In the encounter with the second man,  he was very violent to the victim and took longer  than the defendant was expecting. [***29]  The man  was holding [Jane]'s head down on the bed and the  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *774; 502 P.3d 884, **894; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***25 Page 9 of 18   defendant came and knocked on the [*777]  door  [Jane] yelled to him that she could not get up. The  man ejaculated and the victim got up and let the  defendant into the room. She went to the bathroom  where she was bleeding from the violent encounter  with the [j]ohn and in a lot of pain. The defendant  started touching her saying, “Now it's my turn.”  When she did not respond, he got angry and yelled  at her, “You just F'd them and you‘re not even  paying any attention to me.” She told him that she  was hurt and bleeding. She knew that no matter  how she felt, making the defendant happy was the  priority. CP at 267. In December 2016 or January 2017, the  defendant's father died, and [Jane] and the  defendant moved into his deceased father's house  in Colfax, Washington. At that point, the defendant  continued to advertise and offer [Jane] to people for  sexual encounters, but no longer got money; he just  forced her to have sex with strangers for his own  sexual gratification. Even without them paying him,  [Jane] believed that she had no choice but to  continue to have sex with the strangers who the  defendant arranged for and did not believe she  could [***30]  say no. CP at 268 (emphasis added). The defendant would tie [Jane] to the bed in the  bedroom in Colfax. CP at 269. The court also found: While they were together, [Jane] believed she  could not live without him based on what he had  told her while they were together and the way he  controlled her money, drugs, food, and every facet  of her life. She believed that no one else would be  willing or able to love her because he repeatedly  told her that. … In their time  [**896]  together, her  self-esteem was completely destroyed. CP at 270. ¶66 The trial court entered the following conclusions of  law, some which could also be read in part as findings  of fact or mixed findings and conclusions:  [*778] 3.1. On or between July 1, 2015 and April  3[, 2017], the defendant: 3.1.1.  Recruited,  transported,  transferred,  provided, obtained, bought, purchased, and/or  received by any means [Jane] knowing or in  reckless disregard of the fact that force, fraud, or  coercion would be used to cause [Jane] to engage  in a sexually explicit act or a commercial sex act; or 3.1.1.1. The force/fraud/coercion used to include  [sic] during the hundreds of incidents of sexual  trafficking described by [Jane]. 3.1.1.2. The defendant lied to her about [***31]   what was happening 3.1.1.3. The defendant bound the victim (tied her  up) 3.1.1.4. The defendant exerted psychological  force through controlling her money, her phone, her  drugs, her transportation, and her self-esteem 3.1.1.5. There was evidence of physical coercion  as well, including an immediate threat to physically  harm, restrain, or destroy [Jane]'s property 3.1.1.6. The victim was afraid of the defendant … . 3.2. That these acts or this venture involved  sexual motivation 3.2.1. The evidence supporting sexual motivation  include that the first time she had sex with  someone she did not want to was for his Birthday in  September of 2013 and from that point forward he  would tell her consistently and repeatedly that it  turned him on for her to be with a promiscuous  woman, and 3.3. That any of these acts occurred in the State  of Washington. . … 4.1. That on or between July 1, 2015—April 3,  2017, the defendant 4.1.1. [K]nowingly advanced prostitution by  compelling [Jane] by threat or force to engage in  prostitution or profited from prostitution resulting  from such threat or such force, and 4.1.2. That any of these acts occurred in the  State of Washington. CP at 272-74 (emphasis added).  [*779]  ¶67 The trial [***32]  court conducted a sentencing  hearing. The court calculated Lars Braun's offender  score at one, based on his sole prior conviction for  possession of a controlled substance. The trial court  imposed a sentence of 184 months' confinement for the  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *776; 502 P.3d 884, **895; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***29 Page 10 of 18   human trafficking charge and 34 months' confinement  for the promoting of prostitution charge. The sentences  run concurrently. LAW AND ANALYSIS ¶68 On appeal, Lars Braun challenges his two  convictions and his sentence. Braun also objects to the  superior court judge's comments about COVID-19 and  the George Floyd protests. He asserts that those  remarks establish an appearance of unfairness that  infected the entire proceeding. We begin by analyzing  the validity of Braun's conviction for human trafficking. Human Trafficking ¶69 Lars Braun contends on appeal that the trial court  misconstrued the word “force” used within RCW  9A.40.100, Washington's human trafficking statute,  and the misinterpretation renders the statute void for  vagueness. In turn, Braun maintains that, under a  correct construction of RCW 9A.40.100, the State  presented insufficient evidence to show he violated the  statute's element of the imposition of force, coercion, or  fraud  against  the  victim.  Finally,  according  to  Braun, [***33]  the State failed to prove that any force,  fraud, or coercion caused Jane to engage in commercial  sex. Before deciphering RCW 9A.40.100 and before  deciding whether sufficient evidence supports a  conviction, we outline the legislative history and the  purpose behind RCW 9A.40.100.  [**897]  ¶70 Trafficking in persons is a modern form of slavery  whose victims are commonly women and children. 22  U.S.C. § 7101(b)(1); Aragon v. Che Ku, 277 F. Supp. 3d  1055, 1069 (D. Minn. 2017). Human trafficking is the  fastest growing worldwide criminal industry. Human  Trafficking: A Global Enterprise, FLI'  (July [*780]   31,  2020),  http://www.freeforlifeintl.org/2020/07/31/human- trafficking-a-global-enterprise/; LS,H T:AGP 2 (2010). ¶71 Even before the Washington Legislature created the  state crime of human trafficking, the United States  Congress, in 2000, as part of its authority to implement  the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition of slavery,  enacted the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act,  18 U.S.C. § 1591, the analog to Washington State's  RCW 9A.40.100. The federal statute and numerous  state statutes in general penalize one who recruits,  harbors, transports, transfers, provides, obtains, or  receives by any means another person knowing that  force, fraud, or coercion will be used to cause the  person to engage in forced labor, involuntary servitude,  a sexually explicit act, or a commercial [***34]  sex act.  Marjorie A. Shields, Annotation, Validity, Construction,  and Application of State Statutes Proscribing Human  Trafficking, 101 A.L.R.6th 417, 417 (2015). The federal  statute reads: Whoever knowingly … in or affecting interstate or  foreign commerce, … recruits, entices, harbors,  transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains,  patronizes, or solicits by any means a person …  knowing, or … in reckless disregard of the fact, that  means of force, threats of force, fraud, … or any  combination of such means will be used to cause  the person to engage in a commercial sex act, …  shall be punished as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). ¶72 In 2003, Washington became the first state to  outlaw  human  trafficking.  B B, WDC,S CCST:R CAPAS T  (RCW  43.280.091),  at  4  (2014)  [https://perma.cc/LR7X-QSZH]; L 2003, ch. 267,  § 1 (codified as RCW 9A.40.100). The Washington  Legislature adopted the measure in response to the  murders of Filipina mail-order brides in Washington  State in the 1990s and early 2000s. Velma Veloria, The  Road to H.B. 1175: Making Human Trafficking [*781]   a Crime in the State of Washington, My Story, 9 SJ.S.J. 549, 549-50 (2011). ¶73 Washington's statute, RCW 9A.40.100, declares, in  relevant part: (1) A person is guilty of trafficking [***35]  in the  first degree when: (a) Such person: (i)  Recruits,  harbors,  transports,  transfers,  provides, obtains, buys, purchases, or receives by  any means another person knowing, or in reckless  disregard of the fact, (A) that force, fraud, or  coercion as defined in RCW 9A.36.070 will be used  to cause the person to engage in: (I) Forced labor; . … (III) A sexually explicit act; or 20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *779; 502 P.3d 884, **896; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***32 Page 11 of 18   (IV) A commercial sex act, or … (ii) Benefits financially or by receiving anything of  value from participation in a venture that has  engaged in acts set forth in (a)(i) of this subsection;  and (b) The acts or venture set forth in (a) of this  subsection: . … (ii) Involve a finding of sexual motivation under  RCW 9.94A.835. (Emphasis added.) The state act differs from the federal  statute in that the state statute omits the phrase “threats  of force” from the list of methods employed to cause the  victim to engage in commercial sex. ¶74 For purposes of the prosecution of Lars Braun, the  State sought to prove the crime's elements of (1)  recruiting,  harboring,  transporting,  transferring,  obtaining, purchasing, or retaining Jane (2) while  knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact (3) that  force, fraud, or coercion will be used (4) to cause  Jane [***36]  to engage in (5) forced labor, a sexually  explicit act, or a commercial sex act (6) with a sexual or  financial motivation. This appeal focuses on the second,  third, and fourth elements. Braun does not challenge   [**898]  the [*782]  sufficiency of evidence for purposes  of elements one, five, and six. Force ¶75 The third element of RCW 9A.40.100 identifies  three nouns, “force,” “fraud,” and “coercion,” as the  cause for commercial sex. Despite the inclusion of the  terms “fraud” and “coercion” in the statute, the parties  focus on the word “force” and dispute the meaning of  the term in the context of the statute. ¶76 The trial court found that Lars Braun engaged in all  three activities: force, fraud, and coercion. Thus, we  might limit our review to whether the evidence  supported a conviction for the use of “fraud” or  “coercion” and thereby avoid defining “force,” while  circumventing a weighing of the sufficiency of evidence  for a finding of force. Following a bench trial, when a  single offense can be committed by alternative methods,  a conviction may rest on proof that the crime was  committed by any one of the means charged. State v.  Munson, 120 Wn. App. 103, 107, 83 P.3d 1057 (2004).  We proceed to assess the sufficiency of evidence of  force anyway for two reasons. First, we question [***37]   whether RCW 9A.40.100 presents alternative means.  Second, Braun challenges the sufficiency of evidence  under each potential means and claims insufficient  evidence established causation under either of the three  nouns. We, however, avoid definitively circumscribing  “force” because, under any of the definitions forwarded  by the parties, the evidence supports the trial court's  finding. ¶77 The parties may assume that RCW 9A.40.100's  employment of the disjunctive “or” when listing “force,”  “fraud,” and “coercion,” suggests that the statute creates  alternative means for committing the crime. We question  whether “force” should be isolated and construed  separately from the other methods of triggering  commercial sex. Courts sometimes read the disjunctive  “or” as denoting an [*783]  alternative means crime.  Nevertheless, the use of “or” does not always signify  alternate means. State v. Barboza-Cortes, 194 Wn.2d  639, 643-44, 451 P.3d 707 (2019). Instead, courts ask  whether each noun describes distinct acts that amount  to the same crime. State v. Sandholm, 184 Wn.2d 726,  732, 364 P.3d 87 (2015). The more varied the criminal  conduct, the more likely the statute describes alternative  means. State v. Barboza-Cortes, 194 Wn.2d 639, 644  (2019). When the statute describes minor nuances  inhering in the same act, the more likely the various  alternatives are merely facets of the same criminal  conduct. State v. Sandholm, 184 Wn.2d 726, 732  (2015). ¶78 Generally [***38]  the three words “force,” “fraud,”  and “coercion” connote divergent acts, but we notice a  common theme among these three nouns in the milieu  of human trafficking. Trafficking comprises the  concept of a human being's will being subjugated to the  will of another. United States v. Lewis, 644 F. Supp.  1391, 1403 (W.D. Mich. 1986), aff'd sub nom. United  States v. King, 840 F.2d 1276 (6th Cir. 1988). In the  context of sexual trafficking, the victim believes that  she lacks a viable alternative but to perform services for  the master. Force, coercion, and fraud all lead to a  vanquished independence and destroyed spirit and  generally combine to effectuate sexual trafficking.  Thus, we could analyze the appeal as if force, coercion,  and fraud all equate to usurping one's willpower. ¶79 Neither RCW 9A.40.100 nor a related statute  defines “force.” Lars Braun argues that the trial court  committed legal error when construing the word “force”  in the trafficking statute to include nonphysical force.  Even if we adopted Braun's reading of the statute as  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *781; 502 P.3d 884, **897; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***35 Page 12 of 18   requiring physical force, the overwhelming, if not  undisputed, facts show that Lars Braun employed  corporeal force against Jane and that he knew force  would compel her to engage in commercial sex. [1] ¶80 To repeat, Lars Braun does not challenge any of  the trial court's findings of fact as unsupported [***39]   by the evidence.  [*784]  Instead, Braun argues that the  findings do not support the trial court's conclusions of  law that he committed the crime. We treat unchallenged  findings as verities on appeal. State v. Allen, 138 Wn.  App. 463, 468, 157 P.3d 893 (2007).  [**899]  ¶81 The trial court entered many findings of fact about  Lars Braun imposing physical force on Jane. Braun and  Jane had violent encounters, during which someone  summoned law enforcement. Braun strangulated Jane.  Braun anally raped Jane. Braun slapped Jane in the  face. Braun tied Jane to a tree and left her alone with a  john while he ventured to Taco Bell for more than one  hour. Braun tied Jane to the Colfax bed and other  divans of repose. [2, 3] ¶82 Physical assaults by the defendant on the  victim  constitute  force  for  purposes  of  human  trafficking. United States v. Wilkins, 538 F. Supp. 3d  49, 73 (D.D.C. 2021). Lars Braun's assaults on Jane led  to sex with Braun, not only commercial sex with johns.  The defendant may be both the perpetrator of the force,  fraud, or coercion and the beneficiary of the sexual act.  Ardolf v. Weber, 332 F.R.D. 467, 475-76 (S.D.N.Y.  2019). ¶83 Lars Braun employed physical violence perpetrated  by other men to compel sexual performances from  Jane. When Jane perturbed Braun, Braun solicited  violent men to engage with Jane. Trailer Guy physically  hurt Jane, and Braun issued threats of trysts with sex  with [***40]  Trailer Guy. When having intercourse for  truck repairs, a man violently struck the bed next to  Jane's head. The language of the human trafficking  statutes allows for a conviction even when the  defendant did not personally use force, fraud, or  coercion as long as he knew someone would use such  means. United States v. Todd, 627 F.3d 329, 336 (9th  Cir. 2010) (Smith, J., concurring). ¶84 The only Washington reported decision applying  RCW 9A.40.100, State v. Clark, 170 Wn. App. 166, 283  P.3d 1116 (2012), did not need to identify the nature or  demarcate the extent of force needed for a conviction.  Since RCW 9A.40.100 echoes the federal human  trafficking statute and because  [*785]  State v. Clark  provides limited guidance, we review federal cases to  assist in determining whether evidence supported a  finding or conclusion of force against Jane. In his brief,  Lars Braun often relies on federal decisions. The  Washington antitrafficking statute references federal  trafficking statutes in its legislative history. See F B.R.SH.B. 1175 58th Leg., Reg. Sess.  (Wash.  2003),  http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003- 04/Pdf/Bill%20Reports/House/1175- S.FBR.pdf?q=20210128094842. ¶85 The conduct of Johnelle Lewis Bell, in United States  v. Bell, 761 F.3d 900 (8th Cir. 2014), parallels the facts  behind the prosecution of Lars Braun. A jury convicted  Bell of, among other crimes, sex trafficking [***41]  in  violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Bell met victim Jennifer  Olewnik at a bar. Bell informed Olewnik that he was  going through a divorce, and the two began an intimate  relationship. Bell asked Olewnik if she was interested in  working as a prostitute. Bell assured Olewnik that the  two would continue with a committed, intimate  relationship despite her trade. He would care for her and  help her regain custody of her daughter, and they would  beget children together. With these assurances,  Olewnik agreed to prostitute herself. Bell advertised for  Olewnik‘s services on the Backpage website. Bell later  began physically assaulting Olewnik. When Olewnik  refused to prostitute at a truck stop, Bell told Olewnik  she lacked a choice and struck her with a belt. Olewnik  complied. Bell repeated this conduct with three other  women, one to whom he wrote poetry expressing his  love. When Olewnik discovered that Bell engaged in  sex with one of the other women, she confronted Bell  and threatened to call law enforcement. Bell slapped  Olewnik in the face and choked her. On one occasion,  Bell beat Olewnik for falling asleep while performing a  trick. Bell insisted that Olewnik perform anal sex with  johns. Olewnik performed sex, [***42]  at the request of  Bell, so that the money earned would purchase  narcotics for both of them. At trial, Olewnik announced  her [*786]  continuing love for Bell and her hope he  would fulfill his promises to her. ¶86 On appeal, Johnelle Lewis Bell argued that the  government presented insufficient evidence to convict  him of trafficking. He contended that no evidence  showed that he knew that force, threats of force, fraud,  or coercion would compel Olewnik and the other victims  to perform commercial sex acts. He contended that the  women engaged in the sex acts because of their love  for him. According to Bell, the fact that two of the  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *783; 502 P.3d 884, **898; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***38 Page 13 of 18    [**900]  women left his company established that he did  not force them against their will to perform. ¶87 The federal circuit court, in United States v. Bell,  concluded that the government proved force, under the  federal human trafficking statute, because Bell  physically assaulted the women when they disobeyed  him. The assaults caused the women to perform more  sex acts for Bell. ¶88 In United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d 584 (7th Cir.  2017), McKenzie Carson trafficked a seventeen-year- old girl in part by isolating her from her mother and not  allowing her to access a phone. Carson manipulated  three other women, who were drug users, desperate for  drugs, and homeless. [***43]  When entreating her to  traffic her body, Carson promised one woman,  Veronica Del Valle, that she could keep all money she  made. Carson instead kept almost all of Del Valle's  money. He supplied her drugs. He took her cell phone.  He beat her with belts, slapped her face, gave her black  eyes, and anally raped her. Carson warned Del Valle  not to leave him or he would kill her children. ¶89 On appeal, in United States v. Carson, McKenzie  Carson contended that the women willingly agreed to  work for him as prostitutes. They turned to him for  emotional support. The court did not deem the women's  repeated turning to Carson for support important. Victims of sex trafficking may make decisions  that look voluntary at times due to the incredible  weight of coercion and [*787]  force upon them.  And they may make some decisions along the way  that are truly voluntary. Those decisions do not take  away from the fact that they have been held  hostage, coerced, forced, or threatened to engage  in  commercial  sexual  acts.  Sometimes  that  coercion and force may be subtle, leading a fact- finder to have to decipher whether the mens rea  has been met. But this is not such a case. There is  nothing subtle about rape, beatings, death threats,  and taking [***44]  women's clothes and phones so  that they cannot readily escape. Carson kept these  victims under his control by using a tightly woven  web of rape, physical assault, threats, manipulation,  isolation, and fear. United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d at 591. ¶90 McKenzie Carson, like Lars Braun, also claimed  that he did not know the women worked for him from  force. The court answered: Had Carson truly subjectively believed (whether  correctly or not) that the victims were voluntarily  working for him as prostitutes, he would have had  no reason to rape, beat and threaten them, to take  their telephones, clothing, shoes and control their  access to drugs. United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d at 594. ¶91 Lars Braun's relationship with Jane included  bondage. Jane in fact consented to some bondage acts,  but she testified that Braun went beyond her consent.  Braun argues that this encroachment on consent  constituted a mere betrayal in their relationship, rather  than  force  supporting  a  conviction  for  human  trafficking. He also complains that the legislature never  intended RCW 9A.40.100 to apply to domestic violence  offenses and ordinary prostitution offenses. ¶92 In United States v. Marcus, 487 F. Supp. 2d 289  (E.D.N.Y. 2007), vacated, 538 F.3d 97 (2d Cir. 2008),  rev'd and remanded, 560 U.S. 258, 130 S. Ct. 2159, 176  L. Ed. 2d 1012 (2010), the complaining witness began a  consensual  bondage,  dominance,  and  sadism  relationship with Glenn Marcus. Marcus later [***45]   employed force and coercion to prevent  [*788]  her  from leaving and to engage in sexual conduct that  Marcus and others photographed and placed on a  website. Marcus derived financial benefit from the  photographs. The court rejected Marcus' contention that  Congress did not intend the Trafficking Victims  Protection Act to apply to conduct that occurred within  an intimate, domestic relationship. ¶93 Lars Braun contends that the State may not rely on  any assaults that occurred in Florida. He does not cite  any authority for this argument, however. We anticipate  that any court faced with this contention would rule to  the contrary as long as at least one of the acts of  assault occurred in the home state or if the assaults in  another state led to commercial sex in the home state.  We do not  [**901]  address the argument because  some of the physical force and much of the prostitution  occurred in Washington State. Coercion [4] ¶94 We also conclude that sufficient evidence  supports a conviction of Lars Braun for human  trafficking based on his use of coercion within the  meaning of RCW 9A.40.100. Another statute, RCW  9A.36.070, defines “coercion” as follows: 20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *786; 502 P.3d 884, **899; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***42 Page 14 of 18   (1) A person is guilty of coercion if by use of a  threat he or she compels or induces a person to  engage in conduct which the latter [***46]  has a  legal right to abstain from, or to abstain from  conduct which he or she has a legal right to engage  in. (2) “Threat” as used in this section means: (a) To communicate, directly or indirectly, the  intent immediately to use force against any person  who is present at the time; or (b) Threats as defined in RCW 9A.04.110[28] (a),  (b), or (c). (Emphasis added.) In turn, RCW 9A.04.110 defines the  term “threat” as used in RCW 9A.40.100: (28) “Threat” means to communicate, directly or  indirectly the intent:  [*789] (a) To cause bodily injury in the future to  the person threatened or to any other person; or (b) To cause physical damage to the property of  a person other than the actor; or (c) To subject the person threatened or any other  person to physical confinement or restraint. Since RCW 9A.36.070(2)(b) incorporates the definition  in RCW 9A.40.110, the threat, for a human trafficking  conviction, need not be of immediate force but can  include threats of bodily injury in the future. ¶95 We look to State v. Clark, 170 Wn. App. 166 (2012),  and federal decisions to confirm the use of coercion. In  Clark, this court found the State proved coercion  because of the repeated beatings by DeShawn Clark of  the victim, which led to the victim fearing for her safety if  she did not obey Clark's commands. The court found  coercion even though the victim [***47]  left Clark's  company and voluntarily returned because of love.  According to one federal decision, the opportunity to  escape, and even a successful escape, does not  preclude a finding of involuntary servitude. United  States v. Mussry, 726 F.2d 1448, 1454 (9th Cir. 1984). ¶96 When enacting the Trafficking Victims Protection  Act, Congress desired the means of compelling  commercial sex to apply to not only overt beatings but  more subtle means designed to cause victims to believe  that serious harm will result to themselves or others if  they leave the defendant. United States v. Marcus, 487  F. Supp. 2d 289, 301 (E.D.N.Y. 2007). Congress  intended to reach cases when the trafficker holds  another in a condition of servitude through nonviolent  coercion. United States v. Dann, 652 F.3d 1160, 1169  (9th Cir. 2011); United States v. Bradley, 390 F.3d 145,  150 (1st Cir. 2004); United States v. Marcus, 487 F.  Supp. 2d 289, 302 (E.D.N.Y. 2007). The methods of  subjugating people's wills now include subtle, more  effective forms of coercion. United States v. Mussry,  726 F.2d 1448, 1452 (9th Cir. 1984). A pattern intended  to cause a person  [*790]  to believe that failure to  perform an act of commercial sex would result in  serious harm constitutes evidence of coercion. United  States v. Campbell, 6 F.4th 764, 775 (8th Cir. 2014) (as  amended July 26, 2021). The phenomenon that force  leads to coercion because of the atmosphere of ongoing  beatings illustrates the proximity of the concepts of force  and coercion in the context of human trafficking. ¶97 The federal appeals court, in United States v. Bell,  761 F.3d 900 (8th Cir. 2014), discussed above, agreed  that the government proved force because Johnelle  Lewis Bell physically assaulted [***48]  the women  when they disobeyed him. The court also found that Bell  coerced them into sex acts by implied threats of more  assaults. [5]  ¶98  Lars  Braun  supplied  alcohol  and  methamphetamine to Jane in order to procure and  market her sexual services. When Jane became  addicted  to  methamphetamine,  Braun  withheld  dispensing of the  [**902]  drug until Jane performed. In  United States v. Mack, 808 F.3d 1074 (6th Cir. 2015),  the court affirmed a conviction of a defendant who  coerced the victims into prostituting themselves by  initially supplying them with drugs under the false  pretense they were free. Supplying of drugs shows  manipulation and control of the victim. United States v.  Betts, 911 F.3d 523, 530 (8th Cir. 2018); United States  v. Campbell, 49 F.3d 1079, 1084 (5th Cir. 1995). Fraud ¶99 RCW 9A.40.100 does not define “fraud” for  purposes of human trafficking. This court, when  reviewing another criminal statute, declined to define  “fraud” because of the word's common understanding.  State v. Stacy, 181 Wn. App. 553, 572, 326 P.3d 136  (2014). Federal cases examining human trafficking by  fraud require “material misrepresentations” used to  compel the victim. United States v. Maynes, 880 F.3d  110, 113 (4th Cir. 2018). A false statement is material if  it  has  a  natural  tendency  to  influence  or  is  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *788; 502 P.3d 884, **901; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***45 Page 15 of 18   capable [*791]  of influencing the intended target.  United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509, 115 S. Ct.  2310, 132 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1995). ¶100 The federal circuit court, in United States v. Bell,  761 F.3d 900 (8th Cir. 2014), previously outlined, ruled  that Johnelle Bell also used fraud because he  misrepresented his love for his three victims and his  intent to care [***49]  for each to the exclusion of the  others. Bell preyed on vulnerable women. In United  States v. Mack, 808 F.3d 1074 (6th Cir. 2015), the court  affirmed a conviction of a defendant who led victims into  prostituting themselves by initially supplying them with  drugs under the false pretense the substances were  free. [6] ¶101 Lars Braun defrauded Jane by manipulation,  false promises, and lies to induce her to engage in  prostitution. He told Jane she was his girlfriend, but then  hid their relationship from his acquaintances. Braun  promised her that he would love her if she had sex with  other people for money. Braun told her that, if she  performed as he desired, he would marry her and beget  children with her, both events that she desperately  desired. Based on his representations, Jane believed  Braun loved her. Braun deceptively used Jane's e-mail  address to procure johns. He did not inform Jane of the  parameters of sex he promised the johns. Braun  deceived Jane about advertisements he posted offering  her for sex exploits. He told her that no one else valued  her and then isolated her. The evidence amply  supported the trial court's finding and legal conclusion of  fraud. Causation ¶102 Next Lars Braun contends that insufficient  evidence supported the trial court's [***50]  conclusion  that any force, fraud, or coercion caused Jane to  participate in commercial sexual acts. Stated differently,  according to Braun, the evidence lacked a connection  between  his  violence,  threats  of  violence,  and  misrepresentations sufficient to compel Jane to engage  in prostitution.  [*792]  ¶103 To repeat, Lars Braun does not challenge any  findings of fact. The trial court's findings mention Jane's  initial hesitancy in performing sex for money; Braun's  early insistence that Jane prostitute herself or else he  would cheat on her; his promise to love her if she  garnered profits through sex; Jane's later constant fear  of Braun because of his violence; Braun's demand that  she incur income to pay for the couple's food, gas,  lodging, and copious amounts of alcohol; Braun's  withholding of methamphetamine and food until she  completed a trick; Jane's refusal to report Braun to law  enforcement because of the anger that would result;  Braun's misrepresentation of a john's expected sex acts  before she serviced the john; his pressuring her for  sexual favors because she had been sexually active  with others; and Braun's grabbing of Jane on one  occasion when she hid in a back room from a man  seeking favors. [***51]  ¶104 Jane obeyed Braun's demands because of fear of  the resultant trouble. When Jane disobeyed one of  Braun's rules, Braun ignored her for days, engaged in  sex with other women, and yelled at her. Jane became  completely dependent on Braun for food, alcohol, and  her drug of choice, and Braun withheld these needs and  desires from Jane. Jane could not drive. Braun  possessed all of her belongings. He took all of her  money. In  [**903]  short, like other victims of human  trafficking, the force, fraud, and coercion caused Jane  to rigorously obey Braun‘s whims, including participation  in commercial sex. She had no choice. [7] ¶105 Lars Braun's argument of lack of causation fails  to recognize the unspeakable ruin he wreaked on  another human being's life. He instead challenges this  court to, before affirming his guilt, dissect individual acts  of sex performed by Jane and then identify one act of  force, fraud, or coercion that caused that discrete act.  But human trafficking does not lend itself to this  atomization of cause and effect. The victim engages in  all of her acts because of the triumph by the pimpish  padrone over her personality, autonomy, spirituality,  humanity, individuality, and free [*793]  choice. This  triumph  results [***52]   from  the  trafficker's  masterminding a sweeping environment of force,  coercion, cheating, dishonesty, degradation, and self- loathing. In this opinion, we outlined the prosecution's  extensive facts to demonstrate the ability of one man,  through  persistent  domineering  and  deceptive  demeanor, to control another's willpower. ¶106 Given the realities of various forms of coercion to  which sex traffickers subject their victims, courts  recognize that traffickers often force victims to continue  prostituting by creating an environment of fear and  dependence through the use of threats of violence,  actual violence, and various forms of manipulation  against them. United States v. Wilkins, 538 F. Supp. 3d  49, 72 (D.D.C. 2021). When evaluating if a defendant  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *790; 502 P.3d 884, **902; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***48 Page 16 of 18   exerted coercive force over a complainant, the trier of  fact should evaluate the totality of a defendant's conduct  toward a trafficking victim, including any threats or  specific instances of past violence that may have  created a culture of fear that renders the victim's acts  involuntary. United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d 584, 600  (7th Cir. 2017). ¶107 Lars Braun anally raped Jane on one occasion. In  United States v. Carson, the court recognized the  defendant's rape of the victim as evidence that the  defendant's conduct led to sex acts performed by the  victim.  The  rape  sent  the  message  that  “‘I  control [***53]  you and can do as I please.’” United  States v. Carson, 870 F.3d at 600. [8] ¶108 RCW 9A.40.100 does not require that the State  prove that any sexual act actually occurred. Because  the statute employs the future tense, the sex act is not  an element of the offense. United States v. Maynes, 880  F.3d 110, 114 (4th Cir. 2018). The offender completes  the crime when he recruits, entices, harbors, transports,  provides, obtains, advertises, maintains, patronizes, or  solicits a person knowing, or in reckless disregard  thereof, that means of force, fraud, or coercion of such  means will be used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act. United States  [*794]  v. Maynes,  880 F.3d 110, 114 (4th Cir. 2018). A defendant commits  the crime of trafficking even if the commercial sex act  comes in the future as long as he knew that force, fraud,  or coercion would be employed to cause the victim to  engage in the act. United States v. Todd, 627 F.3d 329,  334 (9th Cir. 2010). Lars Braun recruited, enticed,  harbored, transported, advertised, and maintained Jane  while knowing that he and others would impose force,  coercion, and fraud on her for her sexual favors. ¶109 United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d 584 (7th Cir.  2017),  earlier  reviewed,  answers  Lars  Braun's  contention that the State failed to prove causation.  McKenzie Carson also argued that the evidence did not  support a finding that the women engaged in  commercial sex due to force. The court replied: No  rational  person  could  witness  such  force [***54]  and coercion, let alone inflict it  himself, without knowing or recklessly disregarding  the fact that the threats and force of threats and  coercion, or any combination of them, caused these  women to engage in commercial sex acts. United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d at 594. Vagueness ¶110 Lars Braun next contends that, if this court applies  a definition of “force” in RCW 9A.40.100 that includes  emotional  manipulation,  the  statute  becomes  unconstitutionally vague as applied. Because we do not  adopt any definition of force that includes  [**904]   nonphysical force, we need not address this contention. Promotion of Prostitution [9] ¶111 Lars Braun requests reversal of his conviction  for promoting prostitution in the first degree because the  State presented insufficient evidence that he used  “threat or force” to induce Jane into prostitution, as  required by [*795]  RCW 9A.88.070. RCW 9A.88.070  governs first degree promoting prostitution. The statute  reads, in relevant part: (1) A person is guilty of promoting prostitution in  the first degree if he or she knowingly advances  prostitution: (a) By compelling a person by threat or force to  engage in prostitution or profits from prostitution  which results from such threat or force. (Emphasis added.) RCW 9A.04.110 defines “threat”: (28)  “Threat”  means  to  communicate,  directly [***55]  or indirectly the intent: (a) To cause bodily injury in the future to the  person threatened or to any other person; or (b) To cause physical damage to the property of  a person other than the actor; or (c) To subject the person threatened or any other  person to physical confinement or restraint; or . … (j) To do any other act which is intended to harm  substantially the person threatened or another with  respect to his or her health, safety, business,  financial condition, or personal relationships. ¶112 To prove a threat, the State need not present  evidence of an explicit communicated threat. Threats  can include nonverbal threats. State v. Pinkney, 2 Wn.  App. 2d 574, 579, 411 P.3d 406 (2018). [10] ¶113 The State's argument of sufficiency of  evidence for promoting prostitution mirrors its contention  in favor of affirming Lars Braun's guilt for human  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *793; 502 P.3d 884, **903; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***52 Page 17 of 18   trafficking. According to the State, Braun employed  threats of force and the withholding of food and drugs to  prompt Jane to engage in acts of prostitution. On one  occasion, he destroyed her property in order to gain  control over her activities. For many of the same  reasons that we rule that the evidence suffices to  convict Braun of human trafficking, we hold that the  evidence  supports  his  conviction  for  promoting  prostitution. [***56]   [*796]  ¶114 In State v. Simon, 64 Wn. App. 948, 831 P.2d 139  (1991), aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 120  Wn.2d 196, 840 P.2d 172 (1992), the court considered  force applied by Simon to the victim, when she  mentioned leaving him, sufficient for a conviction of  promoting prostitution. A law enforcement officer also  testified to the unwritten rules between a pimp and a  prostitute  whereby  the  latter  receives  physical  punishment for leaving the pimp. Appearance of Fairness ¶115 Lars Braun asserts that the trial judge violated the  appearance  of  fairness  doctrine  when  uttering  comments from the bench. Before trial, the judge  mentioned Governor Jay Inslee's order regarding  COVID-19. Nevertheless, the trial judge gave everyone  a choice of whether to wear a mask while in the  courtroom. The court questioned the occurrence of the  1917 pandemic. Thereafter, the trial judge lamented the  George Floyd protests in Seattle. After informing  courtroom attendees that they need not obey the  governor's order, the judge complained of anarchy and  the lack of law. He ended by commenting that he had  often pondered those subjects recently. Lars Braun  argues that, based on the totality of the trial judge's  statements, the judge viewed this case as an  opportunity  to  reassert  law  and  order  during  uncertain [***57]  and chaotic times by convicting him. ¶116 All of the trial court's comments occurred before  the court's ruling. Lars Braun did not object, before the  trial court's verdict, to any impartiality of the judge. Nor  does he claim manifest constitutional error on appeal.  We recognize the peril of impugning a judge's  impartiality while the case pends before him or her.  Nevertheless, we question whether Braun preserved  this challenge for appeal. The State, however, does not  ask that we decline review of the issue.  [**905]  [11-15] ¶117 The federal and state constitutions  guarantee a criminal defendant's right to be tried and  sentenced by [*797]  an impartial court. U.S. Const.  amends. VI, XIV; Wash. Const. art. I, § 22; State v.  Solis-Diaz, 187 Wn.2d 535, 539, 387 P.3d 703 (2017).  The law requires more than an impartial judge. The law  demands that the judge also appear to be impartial  pursuant to the appearance of fairness doctrine. State v.  Solis-Diaz, 187 Wn.2d 535, 540 (2017). A judicial  proceeding is valid if a reasonably prudent, disinterested  observer would conclude that the parties received a fair,  impartial, and neutral hearing. State v. Solis-Diaz, 187  Wn.2d at 540. The party asserting a violation of the  appearance of fairness must show a judge's actual or  potential bias. State v. Solis-Diaz, 187 Wn.2d at 540. In  determining a judge's impartiality, this court uses an  objective test that assumes a reasonable observer  knows and understands all [***58]  the relevant facts.  State v. Solis-Diaz, 187 Wn.2d at 540. ¶118 In State v. Solis-Diaz, 187 Wn.2d 535, 541 (2017),  forwarded by Lars Braun, the Washington Supreme  Court remanded to the trial court for resentencing before  a different judge to determine whether Guadalupe Solis- Diaz should be considered for an exceptional mitigated  sentence on the basis of Solis-Diaz's youth. The record  reflected the trial court's frustration and unhappiness at  the Court of Appeals requiring him to address anew  whether Solis-Diaz should be considered for an  exceptional downward sentence. The judge's remarks at  the  first  resentencing  strongly  suggested  that,  regardless of the information presented in mitigation, he  was committed to the original standard range sentence  of 1,111 months. ¶119 Lars Braun's trial judge never uttered any  comments that showed prejudgment of the guilt of Lars  Braun. He never suggested that he wished to make an  example out of Lars Braun. He indicated no frustration  in the state of the law being applied to the prosecution.  Despite complaining of Detective Maurice Washington's  inability to be present in Ellensburg, the trial judge  granted Braun's motion to exclude Washington's  testimony on human trafficking. The judge also  suggested that adults should be free to make [*798]   decisions [***59]   without  restraints  from  the  government.  We  conclude  that  Braun  has  not  demonstrated the trial judge's actual or potential bias. [16, 17] ¶120 A judge's public comments on the  administration of the criminal justice system and  rampant crime do not create reasonable cause for  doubting the judge's partiality. United States v. Sevilla- Oyola, 854 F. Supp. 2d 164, 167-68 (D.P.R. 2012),  vacated in part, 753 F.3d 309, superseded on reh'g, 770  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *795; 502 P.3d 884, **904; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***55 Page 18 of 18   F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2014). To violate the appearance of  fairness doctrine, the judge's comments instead must  directly relate to the pending action. In re Boston's  Children First, 244 F.3d 164, 168-69 (1st Cir. 2001). Offender Score [18, 19] ¶121 The trial court sentenced Lars Braun with  an offender score of one based on an earlier conviction  for possession of a controlled substance. Braun now  contends that this controlled substance conviction  should not count toward his offender score in light of  State v. Blake, 197 Wn.2d 170, 481 P.3d 521 (2021).  He requests resentencing with an offender score of  zero. The State agrees. ¶122 In State v. Blake, 197 Wn.2d 170 (2021), the  Washington high court held that Washington's strict  liability drug possession statute, RCW 69.50.4013(1),  violates due process under both the state and federal  constitutions.  The  court  found  the  statute  unconstitutional and applied its ruling retroactively.  Therefore, we accept the State's concession that  Braun's conviction for possession of a controlled  substance may not impact his offender score.            \""

       "'                                                      A Madison County jury convicted the defendant, Randall  Ray Ward, of two counts of promoting prostitution and  one count of trafficking a person for a commercial sex  act. Following a sentencing hearing, the trial court  imposed an effective sentence of twenty years in  confinement. On appeal, the defendant challenges the  sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions.  He also argues the trial court erred in failing to merge  the convictions regarding S.C. and in failing to [*2]   give the jury an instruction on accomplice testimony.  After reviewing the record and considering the  applicable law, we affirm the defendant\\'s convictions but  remand for merger of Counts three and four. OPINION Facts and Procedural History A Madison County grand jury indicted the defendant,  Randall Ray Ward, for two counts of trafficking a  person for a commercial sex act (Counts one and three)  and two counts of promoting prostitution (Counts two    Page 2 of 8 and four). Following a jury trial, the defendant was  convicted of one count of trafficking a person for a  commercial sex act (Count three) and two counts of  promoting prostitution (Counts two and four). The  defendant was acquitted on Count one. At trial, the  State presented the following facts for the jury\\'s review. T.G. testified she was a heroin addict for twenty years,  and, to support her habit, she began engaging in acts of  prostitution. Initially, she worked for a man named  Chew. However, after a physical altercation, T.G.  wanted more protection. The defendant approached her  and promised to take care of her if she worked as a  prostitute for him. S.C. testified she met the defendant shortly after moving  to Jackson. Like T.G., S.C. was addicted [*3]  to heroin  and moved to Jackson for easier access to drugs. While  in Jackson, S.C.\\'s friend posted an ad for her on  Backpage, a website containing advertisements for  commercial sex services. Three days after her ad was  posted, the defendant contacted S.C. and asked her to  work for him. The defendant promised S.C. she would  \"never have to be dope sick\" again. S.C. explained  \"dope sick[ness]\" occurs when your body goes through  heroin withdrawal. To procure clients for T.G. and S.C., the defendant took  \"almost nude\" photographs of them posing suggestively.  T.G. and S.C., who went by the names \"Barbie\" and  \"Peaches,\" respectively, posed both alone and together.  Although only the defendant took T.G.\\'s pictures, S.C.  testified both the defendant and T.G. took pictures of  her. The defendant then edited the pictures and used  them in advertisements he posted on Backpage. The  advertisements listed T.G. and S.C.\\'s location as  Jackson and provided their cell phone numbers for  potential clients to contact. Neither T.G. nor S.C. had  the password to the defendant\\'s Backpage account and  had no control over the content of the advertisements or  how long they stayed on the website. While working for the [*4]  defendant, T.G. acted as his  \"bottom.\" She explained that this meant she was the  defendant\\'s \"right[-]hand man.\" As a \"bottom,\" T.G. had  access to better quality drugs, slept in her own room,  and recruited women to work in the defendant\\'s  \"stables.\" Additionally, if the defendant were not  present, T.G. was in charge of the other women. T.G. and S.C. testified the defendant was both  physically and mentally abusive. The defendant kept all  of the money they earned, and, if he believed they were  not seeing enough clients, he would withhold drugs until  they earned more money. T.G. estimated she saw eight  to fifteen clients each day and charged $200 per hour.  Although the clients paid T.G. and S.C. directly, all of  the money they earned went to the defendant  immediately after the client left. In addition, the  defendant controlled where T.G. and S.C. slept, when  they ate, and what they wore. The defendant also kept  both T.G. and S.C.\\'s identification in his wallet, only  relinquishing them when they were needed to rent a  hotel room. However, after the room was paid for, the  defendant immediately regained control of the ID. If T.G. refused to perform a sexual act with a client, the  defendant [*5]  would threaten her, asking why she was  \"going to make [him] kill [her].\" The defendant also  threatened to abandon T.G. with \"just the shirt on [her]  back.\" Although she wanted to leave, T.G.\\'s drug  addiction acted like \"invisible handcuffs,\" preventing her  from escaping the defendant\\'s grasp. However, shortly  before the defendant\\'s arrest, T.G. attempted to escape  while the defendant was asleep. As she was running  from the hotel, the defendant chased her, pulled her  hair, and \"threw [her] around.\" S.C. testified she was not forced to see particular clients  as long as she \"made up the money . . . another way.\"  When asked if she were able to come and go as she  pleased, S.C. stated she \"never really tested that  theory\" because she was afraid of what the defendant  would do to her. Once, the defendant was physically  violent with S.C. to \"prove . . . he was in control.\"  Another time, S.C. saw the defendant hit T.G., resulting  in a \"big knot on her head\" and bruises. On June 14, 2017, T.G., S.C., the defendant, and  another woman travelled from Jackson to Memphis to  meet clients. After checking into a hotel, S.C. and the  other woman overdosed on heroin. Although S.C.  recovered from her overdose, [*6]  T.G. took the other  woman to the hospital. Officers from the Bartlett Police  Department arrived at the hospital to investigate the  overdose, and T.G. was taken into custody. However,  T.G. did not initially disclose her relationship with the  defendant because she was only concerned with  \"getting that next lick of dope.\" Likewise, when initially  questioned, S.C. did not reveal her connection with the  defendant. However, after she was arrested in Madison  County two weeks later, S.C. spoke to Special Agent  Chris Carpenter with the Tennessee Bureau of  Investigation and disclosed that she was working as a  prostitute for the defendant. On cross-examination, T.G. acknowledged having perks  2020 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 152, *2 Page 3 of 8 as a result of being the defendant\\'s \"bottom,\" including  additional freedom and her own cell phone, and she  agreed she never reached out to family or friends for  help. T.G. also acknowledged she sometimes used  physical violence or threats to control the other women  when the defendant was not present. Although she was  initially charged with the same offenses as the  defendant, the charges were dropped after she agreed  to cooperate with police. On cross-examination, S.C. agreed she did not reveal  that the defendant [*7]  was physically violent until the  second time she spoke with Special Agent Carpenter  and acknowledged she was allowed to attend rehab  shortly after giving the police her statement. S.C. also  agreed she was allowed to get food without the  defendant but testified T.G. was always with her if the  defendant was not present. Detective Mike Christian with the Bartlett Police  Department responded to a report of an overdose at a  local hospital on June 14, 2017. After speaking with  T.G., Detective Christian obtained a search warrant for  the defendant\\'s hotel room and instructed fellow  detectives to arrest the defendant. Detective Christian  searched the defendant\\'s hotel room, finding a number  of cell phones, a laptop computer, and various  documents. Following the defendant\\'s arrest, Detective  Christian seized the defendant\\'s wallet and a Samsung  Galaxy cellphone. In the defendant\\'s wallet, Detective  Christian discovered S.C.\\'s state-issued ID and a  handwritten note which read \"I, [S.G.], give my human  rights up to my daddy, T-Bone, for the rest of forever as  long as we continue showing our mutual respect  forever.\" S.C. admitted writing the note but testified it  was as a joke. She stated the note [*8]  was a gift for  the defendant because she wanted to do \"something  nice for him.\" Lieutenant Jerry Springer with the Bartlett Police  Department conducted an examination of the Samsung  Galaxy cell phone found on the defendant at the time of  his arrest. During the examination, Lieutenant Springer  extracted videos, photographs, text messages, and  phone logs. In particular, the phone contained scantily  clad pictures of T.G. and S.C. with the names \"Barbie\"  and \"Peaches\" superimposed on them. Lieutenant  Springer also recovered several photographs of the  defendant with T.G. and S.C.. The defendant declined to present evidence. Following  deliberations, the jury found the defendant guilty of  promoting prostitution with regard to his actions against  T.G. (Count two) and trafficking a person for a  commercial sex act and promoting prostitution with  regard to his actions against S.C. (Counts three and  four). The defendant was found not guilty of trafficking  a person for a commercial sex act with regards to T.G.  (Count one). Following a sentencing hearing, the trial  court imposed an effective sentence of twenty years. The defendant filed a timely motion for new trial in which  he argued, in part, the [*9]  evidence at trial was  insufficient to support the jury\\'s verdict and the trial court  erred in refusing to give an accomplice jury instruction  and in refusing to merge Counts three and four. The trial  court denied the motion, and this timely appeal followed. Analysis On appeal, the defendant argues the evidence at trial is  insufficient to support his convictions. The defendant  also argues the trial court erred in refusing to merge his  convictions for promoting prostitution and trafficking a  person for a commercial sex act relating to S.C. and  refusing to give a jury instruction on accomplice  testimony. The State contends the evidence is sufficient  to sustain the defendant\\'s convictions and the trial court  properly refused the accomplice instruction and merger. I. Sufficiency When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged, the  relevant question of the reviewing court is \"whether,  after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to  the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have  found the essential elements of the crime beyond a  reasonable doubt.\" Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307,  319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979); see also  Tenn. R. App. P. 13(e) (\"Findings of guilt in criminal  actions whether by the trial court or jury shall be set  aside if the evidence is insufficient [*10]  to support the  findings by the trier of fact of guilt beyond a reasonable  doubt.\"); State v. Evans, 838 S.W.2d 185, 190-92  (Tenn. 1992); State v. Anderson, 835 S.W.2d 600, 604  (Tenn. Crim. App. 1992). All questions involving the  credibility of witnesses, the weight and value to be given  the evidence, and all factual issues are resolved by the  trier of fact. State v. Pappas, 754 S.W.2d 620, 623  (Tenn. Crim. App. 1987). \"A guilty verdict by the jury,  approved by the trial judge, accredits the testimony of  the witnesses for the State and resolves all conflicts in  favor of the theory of the State.\" State v. Grace, 493  S.W.2d 474, 476 (Tenn. 1973). Our Supreme Court has  2020 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 152, *6 Page 4 of 8 stated the following rationale for this rule: This well-settled rule rests on a sound foundation.  The trial judge and the jury see the witnesses face  to face, hear their testimony and observe their  demeanor on the stand. Thus, the trial judge and  jury are the primary instrumentality of justice to  determine the weight and credibility to be given to  the testimony of witnesses. In the trial forum alone  is there human atmosphere, and the totality of the  evidence cannot be reproduced with a written  record in this Court. Bolin v. State, 219 Tenn. 4, 405 S.W.2d 768, 771 (Tenn.  1966) (citing Carroll v. State, 212 Tenn. 464, 370  S.W.2d 523 (Tenn. 1963)). \"A jury conviction removes  the presumption of innocence with which a defendant is  initially cloaked and replaces it with one of guilt, so that  on appeal a convicted defendant has the burden of  demonstrating that the evidence [*11]  is insufficient.\"  State v. Tuggle, 639 S.W.2d 913, 914 (Tenn. 1982). A. Trafficking a Person for a Commercial Sex Act The jury convicted the defendant of trafficking a person  for a commercial sex act with regards to his actions  against S.C.. As charged in this case, trafficking a  person for a commercial sex act occurs when a person  \"[k]nowingly subjects, attempts to subject, benefits from,  or attempts to benefit from another person\\'s provision of  a commercial sex act\" or \"[r]ecruits, entices, harbors,  transports, provides, purchases, or obtains by any other  means, another person for the purpose of providing a  commercial sex act.\" Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13- 309(a)(1)-(2). For the purposes of subsection (a)(2),  other means may include: (1) Causing or threatening to cause physical harm  to the person; (2)  Physically  restraining  or  threatening  to  physically restrain the person; (3) Abusing or threatening to abuse the law or legal  process; (4) Knowingly destroying, concealing, removing,  confiscating or possessing any actual or purported  passport or other immigration document, or any  other actual or purported government identification  document, of the person; (5) Using blackmail or using or threatening to cause  financial harm for the purpose of exercising  financial control over the person; or (6) Facilitating [*12]  or controlling a person\\'s  access to a controlled substance. Id. § 39-13-309(a)(3). A commercial sex act is \"[a]ny  sexually explicit conduct for which anything of value is  directly or indirectly given, promised to or received by  any person, which conduct is induced or obtained by  coercion\" or \"[a]ny sexually explicit conduct that is  performed or provided by any person, which conduct is  induced or obtained by coercion.\" Id. § 39-13-301(4)(A)- (B). Coercion includes \"[c]ausing or threatening to cause  bodily harm to any person, physically restraining or  confining any person or threatening to physically  restrain  or  confine  any  person;\"  \"[d]estroying,  concealing, removing, confiscating, or possessing any  actual or purported passport or other immigration  document, or any other actual or purported government  identification document, of any person;\" or \"providing a  controlled substance . . . to a person.\" Id. § 39-13- 301(3)(A), (C), (D). The defendant contends the evidence is insufficient  because the \"only proof alleging [the defendant]  trafficked S.C. came from the testimony of her and  T.G..\" The defendant asserts the introduction of hotel  receipts and copies of Backpage advertisements does  not establish the defendant \"compelled or forced\" S.C.  to engage [*13]  in commercial sex acts. At most, the  defendant concedes the State showed he assisted S.C.  with her prostitution \"activities.\" Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, S.C.  testified she began working for the defendant three days  after her first posting on Backpage. The defendant and  T.G. took suggestive photographs of S.C., and the  defendant posted the pictures in an advertisement for  sexual services on Backpage. While working for the  defendant, S.C. was required to give the defendant all of  the money she made working as a prostitute.  Additionally, the defendant controlled where S.C. lived,  what she ate, and what clothes she wore. The  defendant also confiscated S.C.\\'s identification, only  allowing her access to it when she rented hotel rooms  for him. S.C.\\'s identification was in the defendant\\'s  possession at the time of his arrest. While with the  defendant, S.C. was addicted to heroin, and, if the  defendant believed she was not earning enough money,  he withheld drugs until she saw more clients. S.C. also  testified the defendant used physical violence to exert  control over her. Based on this testimony, a rational jury  could find the defendant guilty of trafficking a person  for [*14]  a commercial sex act beyond a reasonable  doubt. The defendant is not entitled to relief on this  issue. 2020 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 152, *10 Page 5 of 8 B. Promoting Prostitution The jury also convicted the defendant of two counts of  promoting prostitution. As charged in this case,  promoting prostitution is defined as \"[e]ncouraging,  inducing, or otherwise purposely causing another to  become a prostitute.\" Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 39-13- 512(4)(A)(iii); -515(a)(1). Prostitution includes \"engaging  in, or offering to engage in, sexual activity as a  business[.]\" Id. § 39-13-512(6). The defendant argues  he cannot be guilty of promoting prostitution because  both S.C. and T.G. engaged in prostitution prior to  meeting him. The evidence, considered in the light most favorable to  the State, showed the defendant, at different times,  approached T.G. and S.C., offering to protect them and  provide them with drugs if they worked for him as  prostitutes. The defendant took suggestive photographs  of S.C. and T.G., edited them, and posted them in  advertisements for sexual services using his Backpage  account. Although the prostitution took place in hotel  rooms rented in either T.G. or S.C.\\'s name, the  defendant provided cash to pay for the rooms and  chose where they stayed. Furthermore, the money  made by T.G. and S.C. while [*15]  working as  prostitutes was given directly to the defendant. Based  on this evidence, a rational jury could find the defendant  guilty of promoting prostitution beyond a reasonable  doubt. The defendant is not entitled to relief on this  issue. II. Failure to Merge Convictions The defendant argues the trial court erred in failing to  merge his convictions for trafficking a person for a  commercial  sex  act  and  promoting  prostitution  regarding S.C.. Specifically, the defendant contends the  prohibition against double jeopardy requires that the two  convictions be merged. While the defendant concedes  the two offenses have different elements, he states \"the  proof at trial essentially was that [the defendant]  recruited [S.C.] [to] work for him as a prostitute.\" Both the federal and state constitutions protect an  accused from being \"twice put in jeopardy of life or limb\"  for \"the same offense.\" U.S. Const. Amend. V; Tenn.  Const. art. 1, sec. 10. The Double Jeopardy Clause  provides three distinct protections: (1) protection against  a second prosecution for the same offense after  acquittal; (2) protection against a second prosecution for  the same offense after conviction; and (3) protection  against multiple punishments for the same offense.  State v. Watkins, 362 S.W.3d 530, 541 (Tenn. 2012). A  claim  that  multiple  convictions [*16]   violate  the  protection against double jeopardy is a mixed question  of law and fact, which this Court will review de novo  without any presumption of correctness. State v. Smith,  436 S.W.3d 751, 766 (Tenn. 2014) (citing State v.  Thompson, 285 S.W. 3d 840, 846 (Tenn. 2009)). The Tennessee Supreme Court has divided single  prosecution, multiple punishment claims into two  categories: (1) unit-of-prosecution claims, \"when a  defendant who has been convicted of multiple violations  of the same statute asserts that the multiple convictions  are for the same offense,\" and (2) multiple description  claims, \"when a defendant who has been convicted of  multiple criminal offenses under different statutes  alleges that the statutes punish the same offense.\" Id.  (citing Watkins, 362 S.W.3d at 543-44). Here, the  defendant is making a multiple description claim. To  address a multiple description claim, we must apply the  two-pronged test articulated in Blockburger v. United  States, 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306  (1932). In a Blockburger analysis, our primary focus is  whether the General Assembly expressed an intent  to permit or preclude multiple punishments. If either  intent has been expressed, no further analysis is  required. When the legislative intent is unclear,  however, we must apply the \"same elements test\"  from Blockburger. Under this test, the first step is to  determine whether the convictions [*17]  arise from  the same act or transaction. The second step is to  determine whether the elements of the offenses are  the same. If each offense contains an element that  the other offense does not, the statutes do not  violate double jeopardy. Smith, 436 S.W.3d at 767 (internal citations omitted).             2020 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 152, *14 Page 6 of 8 In the present case, the defendant\\'s single objective  was to benefit from S.C.\\'s continued work as a  prostitute; thus his acts constituted a continuing course  of conduct and arose out of the same act or transaction.  Therefore, the first prong of the Blockburger test has  been met, and we will focus our analysis on the second  prong of the Blockburger analysis. The defendant was convicted of both promoting  prostitution and trafficking a person for a commercial  act in regards to his actions against S.C.. As charged in  Count four, promoting prostitution is defined as  \"[e]ncouraging,  inducing,  or  otherwise  purposely  causing another to become a prostitute.\" Tenn. Code  Ann. § 39-13-512(4)(A)(iii). Prostitution is \"engaging in,  or offering to engage in, sexual activity as a business[.]\"  Id.  §39-13-512(6).  As  charged  in  Count  three,  trafficking a person for a commercial sex act occurs  when a person \"[k]nowingly subjects, attempts to  subject, benefits from, or attempts to benefit [*18]  from  another person\\'s provision of a commercial act\" or  \"[r]ecruits,  entices,  harbors,  transports,  provides,  purchases, or obtains by any other means, another  person for the purpose of providing a commercial sex  act.\" Id. §39-13-309(a)(1)-(2). The term \"by any means\"  may include: (1) Causing or threatening to cause physical harm  to the person; (2)  Physically  restraining  or  threatening  to  physically restrain the person; (3) Abusing or threatening to abuse the law or legal  process; (4) Knowingly destroying, concealing, removing,  confiscating or possessing any actual or purported  passport or other immigration document, or any  other actual or purported government identification  document, of the person; (5) Using blackmail or using or threatening to cause  financial harm for the purpose of exercising  financial control over the person; or (6) Facilitating or controlling a person\\'s access to a  controlled substance.          Id. § 39-13-309(a)(3). A commercial sex act is \"[a]ny  sexually explicit conduct for which anything of value is  directly or indirectly given, promised to or received by  any person, which conduct is induced or obtained by  coercion\" or \"[a]ny sexually explicit conduct that is  performed  or  provided  by  any  person,  which  conduct [*19]  is induced or obtained by coercion.\" Id. §  39-13-301(4)(A)-(B). Coercion includes \"[c]ausing or  threatening to cause bodily harm to any person,  physically restraining or confining any person or  threatening to physically restrain or confine any person;\"  \"[d]estroying, concealing, removing, confiscating, or  possessing any actual or purported passport or other  immigration document, or any other actual or purported  government identification document, of any person;\" or  \"providing a controlled substance . . . to a person.\" Id. §  39-13-301(3)(A), (C), (D). Here, both promoting prostitution and trafficking a  person for a commercial sex act require the defendant  to cause the victim to perform sexual activities in  exchange for something of value. Although the statute  for trafficking a person for a commercial sex act  contains the additional requirement that the victim be  coerced, the promoting prostitution statute does not  contain an essential element that the trafficking statute  does not. Additionally, because the Blockburger test  must be applied with an objective or abstract view, we  conclude any additional differences in the wording of the  two statutes do not constitute separate elements.   [*20] See State v. Gray, No. W2017-01897-CCA-R3- CD, 2018 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 700, 2018 WL  4382093, at *10 (Tenn. Crim. App. Sept. 14, 2018)  (noting the Blockburger test was applied with an  objective or abstract view by Watkins and its progeny),  no perm. app. filed. Therefore, because only one of the  offenses has an element the other does not, the  defendant\\'s convictions in Counts three and four must  merge. On remand, the trial court should merge the  Class E felony conviction for promoting prostitution into  the Class B felony conviction for trafficking a person for  a commercial sex act. See State v. Banes, 874 S.W.2d  73, 81 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993). The defendant also argues his convictions in Counts  three and four should merge because promoting  prostitution is a lesser-included offense of trafficking a  person for a commercial sex act. The State does not  address this argument in its brief. An offense is a lesser- included offense of a charged offense if \"[a]ll of its  statutory elements are included within the statutory  elements of the offense charged.\" Tenn. Code Ann. §  2020 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 152, *17 Page 7 of 8 40-18-110(f)(1). As discussed above, all of the  statutory elements of promoting prostitution are included  within the statutory elements of trafficking a person for  a commercial sex act. Thus, the trial court erred in  determining promoting prostitution was not a lesser- included offense of trafficking a person for a  commercial  sex  act,  and  the  defendant\\'s [*21]   convictions should merge. III. Jury Instruction The defendant argues the trial court erred in refusing to  give an accomplice jury instruction regarding T.G.\\'s  testimony. Specifically, the defendant contends T.G.\\'s  testimony indicated she recruited women to work for the  defendant, took pictures of S.C. for the defendant\\'s  Backpage advertisements, engaged in threats and  violence to control the other women when the defendant  was not present, and was initially charged with the same  offenses as the defendant. The defendant argues this  testimony indicates T.G. was an accomplice in his  offenses regarding S.C.. The State contends the trial  court properly declined to give the accomplice jury  instruction. A defendant has a right to a correct and complete jury  charge. State v. Garrison, 40 S.W.3d 426, 432 (Tenn.  2000). This right is constitutional in nature. State v.  Phipps, 883 S.W.2d 138, 142 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994).  The trial court must present the propositions of law  governing the case plainly to the jury, in such a manner  as to enable them to comprehend the principles  involved. State v. Williamson, 919 S.W.2d 69, 80 (Tenn.  Crim. App. 1995). \"Nothing short of this will \\'satisfy the  demands of justice\\' or the defendant\\'s right to a jury  trial.\" Id. (quoting Crawford v. State, 44 Tenn. 190, 195  (1867)). It is well-established that \"a conviction may not be  based upon the uncorroborated testimony of an  accomplice.\" [*22]  State v. Shaw, 37 S.W.3d 900, 903  (Tenn. 2001) (citing State v. Bigbee, 885 S.W.2d 797,  803 (Tenn. 1994)). This Court has defined the term  \"accomplice\" to mean \"one who knowingly, voluntarily,  and with common intent with the principal unites in the       commission of a crime.\" State v. Allen, 976 S.W.2d 661,  666 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1997). This means that the  person must do more than have a guilty knowledge, be  morally delinquent, or participate in other offenses with  the principal actor. State v. Jackson, 52 S.W.3d 661,  666 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2001). The test for whether a  witness qualifies as an accomplice is \"whether the  alleged accomplice could be indicted for the same  offense charged against the defendant.\" Allen, 976  S.W.2d at 666. The issue of whether the court or the jury determines a  witness\\'s status as an accomplice has been previously  determined by this Court: The question of who determines whether a witness  is an accomplice depends upon the evidence  introduced during the course of a trial. When the  undisputed evidence clearly establishes the witness  is an accomplice as a matter of law, the trial court,  not the jury must decide the issue. On the other  hand, if the evidence adduced at trial is unclear,  conflicts, or is subject to different inferences, the  jury, as the trier of fact, is to decide if the witness  was an accomplice. If the jury finds the witness was  an accomplice, the jury must decide whether the  evidence [*23]   adduced  was  sufficient  to  corroborate the witness\\'s testimony. State v. Griffis, 964 S.W.2d 577, 588 (Tenn. Crim. App.  1997) (footnote omitted). In the present case, the trial court correctly noted there  was no testimony from S.C. indicating she engaged in a  commercial sex act or any type of prostitution at the  direction of T.G.. However, T.G. testified she worked as  the defendant\\'s \"bottom\" or \"right[-]hand man.\" As the  defendant\\'s \"bottom,\" T.G.\\'s responsibilities included  recruiting women to work as prostitutes for the  defendant and supervising the other women when the  defendant was not present. To control the women, T.G.  sometimes used threats and physical violence. S.C.  testified T.G. took pictures of her for the defendant\\'s  Backpage  advertisements.  Additionally,  prior  to  cooperating with the police, T.G. was charged with the  same crimes as the defendant. We agree with the defendant that the record contains  evidence from which the jury could have inferred T.G.  was an accomplice. However, the trial court failed to  present this factual dispute to the jury in the form of a  jury instruction. Nevertheless, when a trial court fails to  properly instruct the jury concerning accomplice  testimony, such an error is subject to harmless error  2020 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 152, *20 Page 8 of 8 analysis. [*24]  See State v. Ballinger, 93 S.W.3d 881,  888 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2000). Such an error is harmless  when \"the record contains sufficient corroboration to [the  accomplice\\'s] testimony.\" Id. Here, even if the jury found T.G. to be an accomplice,  the State presented sufficient evidence at trial to  corroborate her testimony. \"[C]orroborating evidence is  sufficient if it connects the accused with the crime in  question.\" Griffis, 964 S.W.2d at 589. S.C. testified the  defendant approached her about working for him as a  prostitute. The defendant took semi-nude, suggestive  pictures of S.C. and posted them in an advertisement  for sexual services using his Backpage account. S.C.  also testified the that defendant maintained possession  of her identification, restricted her supply to drugs, used  threats and physical violence to exert control over her,  and confiscated any money she made while working as  a prostitute. This testimony constitutes more than  sufficient  corroboration  of  T.G.\\'s  testimony.  Furthermore, T.G. was vigorously cross-examined at  trial about her relationship with the defendant and  participation in the offenses regarding S.C.. Accordingly,  any failure of the trial court to properly instruct the jury  concerning T.G.\\'s status as an accomplice or the need  for her testimony to [*25]  be corroborated was  harmless. The defendant is not entitled to relief on this  issue.          '"

       "'                   DECISION AND ORDER Petitioner Anthony Thompson seeks relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. On March 8, 2017, the Court sentenced  Petitioner to 188 months\\' imprisonment following his plea of guilty to one count of sex trafficking of a minor, in  violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1) and (b)(2). Petitioner\\'s appeal is currently pending before the Second Circuit.  See Second Circuit Docket No. 17-822. \"[T]here is no jurisdictional bar to a district court\\'s adjudication of a § 2255 motion during the pendency of a direct  appeal.\" United States v. Outen, 286 F.3d 622, 632 (2d Cir. 2002) (emphasis omitted). However, \"district courts in  this Circuit have generally denied without prejudice as premature those § 2255 motions that are filed during the  pendency of a direct appeal.\" Rivera v. United States, 16-CV-5238(KMW), 13-CR-424-1(KMW), 2016 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 189643, 2016 WL 9022576, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2016) (collecting cases). This practice arises out of  considerations \"of judicial economy and the concern that the results on direct appeal may make the district court\\'s  efforts on [*2]  the § 2255 motion a nullity.\" Outen, 286 F.3d at 632. See also Womack v. United States, 395 F.2d  630, 631, 129 U.S. App. D.C. 407 (D.C. Cir. 1968) (\"We are of the view that there is no jurisdictional bar to the  District Court\\'s entertaining a Section 2255 motion during the pendency of a direct appeal but that the orderly  administration of criminal law precludes considering such a motion absent extraordinary circumstances.\"); 1976  Advisory Committee Note to Rule 5 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings for the United States District  Page 2 of 2   Courts (\"There is no requirement that the movant exhaust his remedies prior to seeking relief under § 2255.  However, the courts have held that such a motion is inappropriate if the movant is simultaneously appealing the  decision.\") (citing Womack, supra). Petitioner states that he filed his § 2255 motion before exhausting his appellate remedies because he is actually  innocent, and because his appellate counsel filed an Anders brief. These arguments do not rise to the level of  \"extraordinary circumstance[s]\" that might justify resolving Petitioner\\'s § 2255 motion now, particularly in light of the  fact that an actual innocence claim is \"demanding and permits review only in the extraordinary case.\" House v. Bell,  547 U.S. 518, 538, 126 S. Ct. 2064, 165 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2006) (quotation marks omitted). Petitioner\\'s § 2255 motion (Docket No. 113) is therefore denied without prejudice. Petitioner may still file a § 2255  motion once his conviction becomes final. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1) and Rule 11(a) of the Rules  Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, the [*3]  Court declines to issue a certificate of appealability because  Petitioner has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. Finally, the Court certifies,  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(3), that any appeal taken from this decision would not be taken in good faith. Thus,  leave to appeal in forma pauperis is denied. Petitioner is nonetheless advised that, should he decide to appeal this  Decision and Order, \"Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a) governs the time to appeal,\" and \"[a] timely notice of  appeal must be filed even\" though the Court declined to issue a certificate of appealability. Section 2255 Rule 11(b). The Clerk of the Court shall take all steps necessary to close the parallel civil action, 18-CV-257-A -A. SO ORDERED.

The Government resists. Hearing was held in the matter on  February 26, 2013, with B. John Burns representing Defendant, and Stephen O\\'Meara representing the  Government. The matter is fully submitted and ready for disposition. I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND On November 6, 2012, a Superseding Indictment issued charging Defendant with conspiracy to commit sex  trafficking or to knowingly benefit from sex trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a)(2) and 1594 (Count 1);  two counts of sex trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a)(1), 1591(a)(2), 1591(a)(2), and 1591(b)(1)  (Counts 2 and 3); four counts of coercion and enticement to travel in interstate commerce for prostitution in  violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422(a) and (b) (Counts 4 through 7); conspiracy to engage in interstate transportation for  prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 (Count 8); and four counts of interstate transportation for prostitution in  violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2421 (Counts 9 through 12). The Superseding Indictment alleged that between November  2010 and June 2011, Defendant used force, coercion, fraud, or threats to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce one  or more individuals to travel interstate for the purpose of prostitution. A four-day jury trial was held on November 15, 16, 17, and 20, 2012. During closing statements, Defendant\\'s  counsel informed the jury that Defendant [*3]  admitted being involved in prostitution as charged in Counts 8  through 12 and asked the jury to return a guilty verdict as to those Counts. The jury returned its verdict on  November 20, 2012, finding Defendant guilty on all counts. II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND At the close of the Government\\'s case as well as at the conclusion of trial, Defendant moved for judgment of  acquittal on Counts 1 through 7. Defendant renewed this motion on November 28, 2012, asserting that \"taken in a  light most favorable to the Government, there was insufficient evidence for a rational jury to find beyond reasonable  doubt that all of the elements of the charged offense were established.\" Def.\\'s 1st Mot. for J. of Acquittal and for  New Trial (Def\\'s 1st Mot.) 1, ECF No. 136. Additionally, Defendant contends the \"jury\\'s verdict was against the        Page 5 of 21   weight of the evidence on counts 1 through 7,\" as \"the evidence establishes that each person participated willingly  and on her own volition,\" so he should be granted a new trial. Id. at 2. The Government resisted Defendant\\'s First Motion on December 7, 2012, stating that the evidence at trial was  sufficient to support a jury verdict against Defendant on all counts, and that \"the weight [*4]  of the evidence at trial  is substantially in favor of upholding the verdict of guilty against Defendant on each and every count of the  Superseding Indictment.\" Govt. Br. Resist. to Def.\\'s 1st Mot. 6-8. The Government supplemented its resistance on  December 10, 2012, to explain why Defendant is not a \"benevolent pimp.\" Govt. Supp. Br. Resist. to Def.\\'s 1st Mot.  1-2, ECF No. 138. Defendant filed an addendum to his Motion for New Trial on February 22, 2013, more fully setting forth evidence  presented at trial to support his argument that the Government failed to meet its burden to prove that Defendant  committed Counts 1 through 7. The Government filed a resistance to the arguments raised in Defendant\\'s  addendum on February 26, 2013. Defendant filed under seal a Second Motion for New Trial on March 4, 2013, asserting a new trial is necessary  under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(b)(1), as Defendant has located and interviewed T.A., the sister of  Sabra Addison (Addison), \"a key witness for the government,\" and that T.A. \"was able to provide information that  was unavailable to the parties at the time of trial, but that would, in reasonable likelihood, change the outcome of  trial.\" Def.\\'s 2d Mot. for New Trial 1, ECF No. 188. [*5]  The Government filed its resistance to Defendant\\'s Second  Motion on March 18, 2013, arguing that this evidence was not newly discovered, the Defendant was not diligent in  his efforts to find this witness before or during the trial, the new evidence was merely impeaching of Addison\\'s  testimony, the new evidence was not material to the main issues at trial, and the new evidence would probably not  result in an acquittal. The Government supplemented its resistance to Defendant\\'s Second Motion for New Trial on March 18, 2013,  discussing witness credibility and whether the jury could consider the vulnerabilities of alleged victims and their  voluntary prostitution activities in deciding whether Defendant was guilty of the crimes charged. Defendant  responded to the Government\\'s resistance and supplemental resistance on March 28, 2013, asserting that T.A.\\'s  testimony was newly discovered and would provide material evidence that is important for more than just  impeachment of her sister, and also arguing that there were no \"vulnerable victims\" and there was no \"climate of  fear\" present under the facts of this case. III. DISCUSSION A. Motion for Judgment of Acquittal 1. Standard for Motion for Judgment [*6]  of Acquittal HN1[ ] The Court \"must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to  sustain a conviction.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a). In determining whether the evidence is insufficient to sustain  Defendant\\'s conviction, the Court views all \"evidence in the light most favorable to the government, resolving  conflicts in the government\\'s favor, and accepting all reasonable inferences that support the verdict.\" United States  v. Acosta, 619 F.3d 956, 960 (8th Cir. 2010) (quoting United States v. Scofield, 433 F.3d 580, 584-85 (8th Cir.  2006)). \"In ruling on a motion for acquittal, the role of the district court is not to weigh evidence or consider the  credibility of the witnesses, but rather to determine whether the Government has presented evidence on each  element sufficient to support a jury verdict.\" United States v. Chavez, 230 F.3d 1089, 1091 (8th Cir. 2000) (citations  omitted); see also Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 16, 98 S. Ct. 2141, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1978) (\"Even the trial  court, which has heard the testimony of witnesses first hand, is not to weigh the evidence or assess the credibility of  witnesses when it judges the merits of a motion for acquittal.\") (citations omitted). \"The standard of review is very  strict, and we will reverse a conviction only if we conclude that no reasonable jury could have found the accused  Page 6 of 21   guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" United States v. Nolen, 536 F.3d 834, 842 (8th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted)  (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court \"will [*7]  not lightly overturn a jury\\'s verdict.\" United States v.  McCloud, 590 F.3d 560, 566 (8th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). Defendant contends that \"the jury\\'s verdict was against the weight of the evidence on counts 1 through 7,\" as \"the  evidence does not establish that force, threats of force, coercion or fraud were used to induce any person to  engage in commercial sex acts or that Mr. Bell persuaded, induced, enticed or coerced any person to travel in  interstate commerce to perform commercial sex acts.\" Def.\\'s 1st Mot. 2, ECF No. 136. Additionally, he asserts that  there was insufficient evidence to support a finding by the jury of his guilt on Counts 1 through 3, as the jury could  not have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant \"knew or acted in reckless disregard for the fact that  force, threats of force, fraud or coercion would be used to cause victims to engage in commercial sex acts.\" Id.  at 1-2. He makes a similar argument regarding Counts 4 through 7, stating that there was insufficient evidence to  support a finding by the jury of his guilt on Counts 4 through 7, as the jury could not have found beyond a  reasonable doubt that Defendant \"persuaded, induced, enticed or coerced other persons to travel in interstate  commerce to perform commercial [*8]  sex acts.\" Id. at 2. 2. Summary of the Evidence At trial, the Government presented the testimonies of the law enforcement officers who were involved in the  investigation that lead to Defendant\\'s arrest and indictment. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent  Brian Getson (SA Getson) testified that in June 2011, he was working undercover in the Omaha, Nebraska, field  office assisting in the investigation of prostitution rings. Tr. 50-51. SA Getson explained that as part of the  investigation, he would identify ads from the Internet that appeared to be offering prostitution services and took  special note of advertisements that listed out-of-state phone numbers. Id. at 57. As part of this process, he called  about an ad listed on the female escort link on the website, \"Backpage.com,\" that listed an Arkansas phone  number. Id. at 54-55. SA Getson went to the hotel later identified as Town House Inn and Suites in Omaha; SA  Getson encountered Defendant, who instructed SA Getson to go to room 202. Id. at 64. SA Getson then met the  woman advertised on the website and the two discussed details of the commercial sex act that was to be  performed. Id. at 65. After SA Getson placed the money for the sex act on the dresser, which indicated [*9]  that the  arrangement for the commercial sex act had been transacted, SA Getson signaled the other officers, who came in  and arrested three women and the Defendant. Id. at 66. SA Getson observed that one of the women, later identified as Addison, was sitting in the backseat of a police  vehicle, was looking down, and not engaging with anyone. Id. at 66. Upon seeing Addison in the police vehicle, SA  Getson attempted to engage Addison in conversation, but Addison was initially unresponsive and would not make  eye contact with him. Id. When SA Getson inquired about Addison\\'s condition, he remembered Addison referring to  Defendant and saying, \"\\'I know he knows we\\'re talking to you, I know he knows we\\'re talking.\\'\" Id. at 98. FBI Special Agent Arthur Roche (SA Roche) testified that [*10]  in June 2011, he was assisting with an undercover  operation relating to prostitution in the Omaha area, setting up meetings with prostitutes as an undercover agent,  as well supporting other undercover officers. Id. at 71-72. SA Roche was working foot surveillance on June 18,  2011, in order to provide backup for SA Getson at the Town House Inn and Suites operation. After SA Getson  entered the motel room and gave the signal that an arrest was being made, SA Roche witnessed Defendant exiting  room 201 of the motel, detained Defendant, identified himself as a law enforcement officer, and frisked Defendant  for weapons and contraband. Id. at 73. SA Roche read Defendant his Miranda rights, and Defendant agreed to       Page 7 of 21   speak with the agents involved in the investigation. Id. SA Roche testified that Defendant informed him at the motel  that the rooms were in his girlfriend\\'s name, referring to Brittany Lawson (Lawson). Id. at 74. After speaking with Defendant, SA Roche observed Addison in a police vehicle several feet away, sitting alone in  the backseat. Id. at 75. SA Roche testified that when he observed Addison in the police vehicle, she was visibly  trembling, kept her head down, and had smeared makeup indicating that she had been crying. [*11]  Id. at 75-79. FBI Special Agent Karen Walsh (SA Walsh) testified that she assisted in the prostitution investigation at the Town  House Inn and Suites in June 2011. Id. at 80. She assisted in the undercover operation by providing surveillance at  the motel while the undercover officer entered the motel, as well as by providing support once an arrest signal was  given. Id. at 80-81. After the arrest signal was given by SA Getson, SA Walsh entered the motel, secured one of the  motel rooms, and stayed with Lawson in the motel room. Id. at 83. Lawson told SA Walsh that Defendant was in  custody of her driver\\'s license and her room key, and that she was in love with Defendant. Id. at 84. Although  Lawson was unwilling to communicate further with SA Walsh, she opened up when she realized she could leave if  she cooperated. Id. at 85. After speaking with Lawson, SA Walsh observed Addison in the backseat of a police  vehicle, very closed off, hunched over with a wad of tissues in her hand and smeared make-up all over her face. Id.  at 86-87. SA Walsh testified that Addison looked very scared, and that SA Walsh thought Addison was sitting in the  vehicle for safety. Id. at 87. FBI Special Agent Chad Hankins (SA Hankins) testified that he was the agent in charge of collecting all of [*12]  the  evidence seized at the Town House Inn and Suites operation on June 18, 2011. Id. at 91. Among other items  seized, he collected $1193.00 in cash from Defendant\\'s person. Id. at 92. FBI Special Agent Anna Brewer (SA Brewer) testified that she was also involved in the operation at the Town  House Inn and Suites on June 18, 2011. Id. at 93-94. While at the investigation site, she observed Addison crying  and shaking while sitting in the fetal position in the backseat of a police vehicle. Id. at 94. Further into the  investigation, SA Brewer requested a grand jury subpoena for Backpage.com postings from January 1, 2011, to  June 18, 2011, relating to escort services or prostitution. Id. at 717-18. The Government also presented the testimonies of several women who worked as Defendant\\'s prostitutes. Jennifer  Olewnik (Olewnik) testified that she came from a broken home and was shuttled back and forth between her mother  and father, that she was hospitalized several times for psychiatric problems, and that she was eventually prescribed  medication for anxiety and bipolar disorder. Id. at 103-05. Olewnik dropped out of school, became pregnant, and  had a daughter when she was seventeen. Id. at 113-14. Olewnik became involved in drugs and eventually  relinquished custody of [*13]  her daughter to her mother. Id. In January 2010, after a period of drug and alcohol  abuse, homelessness, and entanglement with law enforcement, Olewnik moved in with her mother and other family  members in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Id. at 117. Olewnik met Defendant at a bar in the summer of 2010. Id. at  118. Defendant told Olewnik he was from New Jersey and that he was going through a divorce. Id. at 119. Olewnik  said that she and Defendant began an intimate relationship and that they kept in touch after he returned to New  Jersey. Id. Around that time, Olewnik was hospitalized for about two weeks; when she got out of the hospital, she  started seeing Defendant. Id. at 120. Olewnik described having feelings for Defendant, that she really cared for him,  and that Defendant told her he loved her. Id. at 121-22. In the fall of 2010, Defendant asked Olewnik if she wanted to start making some money working for him as a  prostitute. Id. at 121. Defendant promised Olewnik that if she worked as a prostitute for him, he would take care  of her and make sure she had everything she needed. Id. at 120. Defendant told Olewnik he would be with her for a  long time, she would no longer have to work from nine to five, that he would help her get her daughter back, and  that they [*14]  would have children together. Id. at 122-23. Olewnik said that at the time, she had regular  employment but that \"the dreams Mr. Bell threw out at [her] sounded much better than that,\" so on or about  November 1, 2010, Olewnik agreed to begin prostituting for Defendant; Olewnik said that before that time, she had  never engaged in nor considered engaging in prostitution. Id. at 124-25. Once Olewnik agreed to be Defendant\\'s prostitute, Defendant took Olewnik away from her home and her daughter  in Philadelphia, to New Jersey, and then to Maryland to be trained as a prostitute. Id. at 126-27. Olewnik learned  Page 8 of 21   that she had to give all the money she earned to Defendant and that she was never to talk to other pimps because  it would be disrespectful to Defendant. Id. at 123, 130. Olewnik explained that Defendant advertised Olewnik\\'s  services through the Backpage.com website and that customers contacted Defendant at the e-mail address,  \"Gogetemtiger84@yahoo.com.\" Id. at 136. Olewnik testified that the advertisements included her photograph, the  sex acts that were available, how much the services cost, and Olewnik\\'s location. Id. at 199. After leaving Maryland, Defendant arranged to take Olewnik and other prostitutes to Columbia, South Carolina, and  then to Little Rock, [*15]  Arkansas, to engage in commercial sex acts mostly at truck stops. Id. at 137, 144.  Olewnik testified that while they were in Little Rock, she told Defendant that she did not want to prostitute for him  at truck stops. Id. at 144-45. Defendant told Olewnik, \"you have no choice,\" and when Olewnik continued to refuse,  Defendant beat her with a belt until she agreed to work the truck stops for him. Id. By December 10, 2010, Defendant took on another prostitute, Courtney Mayberry (Mayberry). Id. at 148. When  Olewnik found out Defendant started a relationship with Mayberry, Olewnik threatened to call the police. Id.  Defendant struck Olewnik in the face, causing her to fall over; Olewnik stumbled into the bathtub, and Defendant  began choking her and telling Olewnik that if she ever threatened to call the cops again, he would kill Olewnik and  her family, especially her daughter. Id. at 151. Olewnik called her mother and said she wanted to come home, but  she was not ready to give up drugs, which was her mother\\'s condition if Olewnik returned. Id. at 153-55. Olewnik  also told her mother that she still cared for Defendant and hoped he would keep his promises, and [*16]  Olewnik  decided to stay with Defendant for the time being. Id. at 154-55. Olewnik testified that in January 2011, Defendant brought Lawson on as another prostitute. Id. at 159. After that,  Olewnik and Mayberry left Defendant and went out on their own. Id. at 160-64. Olewnik worked as a prostitute for  Mayberry; the money was used to buy drugs. Id. at 161-62. Olewnik left Mayberry and moved in with a drug dealer,  but in March, with nowhere to go, Olewnik called Defendant because she still cared for him and wanted to feel safe.  Id. at 163. The only people she knew in Arkansas were crack dealers, pimps, Defendant, and Mayberry. Id. at 165.  Defendant told Olewnik if she came back, she had to work and be loyal to him. Id. Olewnik testified that she  believed she had a future with Defendant, but she could not be disrespectful to him again. Id. at 163-64. After traveling to several cities in the southern United States for prostitution, Defendant left Olewnik in a hotel  room in Augusta, Georgia, to perform commercial sex acts while he had Lawson and another girl — Francesca —  work for him in South Carolina. Id. at 171-72. Defendant posted ads for all three girls during this period of time,  even though Olewnik was left in Augusta. Id. at 172. Olewnik continued to perform commercial sex acts, [*17]  per  Defendant\\'s instructions, until Defendant returned. Id. When Defendant returned to the Augusta hotel, he found  Olewnik sleeping, so he slapped her and kicked her when she fell to the floor. Id. at 173. His physical abuse caused  Olewnik to suffer bruising on her ribs and her face. Id. After beating Olewnik, Defendant warned her that she better  not fall asleep unless she had enough money to give to Defendant when he returned. Id. Following the beating in Augusta, Defendant continued to physically abuse Olewnik by slapping her in the face and  otherwise treating her roughly. Id. at 173-74. He also made threats to her and her family if she ever left Defendant,  lied to him, or told the police about him. Id. at 174. Olewnik also noticed Defendant taking a gun with him when they  traveled in the summer of 2011. Id. at 175-76. Defendant also made it clear that he had other people to carry out his  threats if necessary, whether against Olewnik, her family, or her daughter. Id. at 211. In May of 2011, Lawson and Olewnik traveled with Defendant to Des Moines, Iowa, to perform commercial sex  acts at Defendant\\'s instruction. Id. at 180-81. Following that trip, the group went to Denver, Colorado, where they all  got tattoos. Id. at 182. Defendant had Lawson get a tattoo of one [*18]  of his pimp nicknames, \"Bam.\" Id. at 182- 83. Shortly after the trip to Denver, Olewnik was arrested in the Shreveport and Bossier City area for prostitution.  Id. at 184. Olewnik did not tell the police about Defendant, as she was scared of him. Id. at 185, 211. When Olewnik  was let out of jail on bond, she was picked up by Lawson, Defendant, and T.A., as well as T.A.\\'s two children. Id. at  188.  Page 9 of 21   Within the next few days, Defendant drove T.A. back home so she could leave her kids there and come back, and  T.A. brought her sister, Addison, back with her. Id. at 189-90. While the group was in Texarkana, Texas, T.A. was  posted for commercial sex acts; and although Addison also may have been posted, Addison did not actually  perform any commercial sex acts. Id. at 191. Olewnik testified that she thought Defendant wanted to have Addison  work for him because the only reason Defendant kept a female around was as a prostitution recruit. Id. at 191-92.  After working in Texarkana for a few days, the group took T.A. back to Hot Springs and went on to Fayetteville. Id.  at 192. After they had spent a few days in Fayetteville, the group traveled to Des Moines to perform commercial  sex acts. Id. at 195. Olewnik, Lawson, and Addison were all posted for commercial sex acts while in Des Moines  in June of 2011. [*19]  Id. at 196. Olewnik testified that Defendant routinely physically abused her if she upset him in any way, so she attempted to  follow his every command, including performing for customers an anal sex act referred to as a \"Backyard Special,\"  even though it hurt Olewnik and she hated it. Id. at 149-51, 173-74, 197-98. Defendant\\'s commands also required  her to pose in ads for a \"Backyard Special\" in Des Moines on June 16, 2011. Id. at 206-07. Olewnik confirmed that  on June 15, 2011, Lawson and Addison were posted for a two-girl session in Des Moines. Id. at 207-08. While  Addison was with the group, Olewnik told Addison that Defendant had physically abused Olewnik in the past and  that Defendant beat her after she fell asleep in Augusta, Georgia. Id. at 213. Olewnik had also told Mayberry about  Defendant\\'s abuses, and Mayberry witnessed the bathtub incident herself. Id. at 216. Immediately after the police investigation broke up Defendant\\'s group on June 18, 2011, Olewnik entered the  Walter Hoving Home in New York, which is an all-women\\'s Christian-based rehabilitation facility. Id. at 218. After  being there for a brief period of time, she went to the Friends Hospital (Friends) for treatment. Id. at 219. While at  Friends, Olewnik told her treatment team that she had been physically, emotionally, [*20]  and mentally abused by  Defendant, referring to him as her ex-boyfriend and pimp. Id. at 220. Olewnik was at Friends approximately two  weeks before she moved in with her father for a brief period of time and then lived in Philadelphia with her mother.  Id. at 220-21. Olewnik later joined Lawson in New Orleans, Louisiana, with a new pimp for whom Lawson was working. Id. at  221. Olewnik stayed with Lawson and her pimp for a few weeks, and she performed commercial sex acts and  gave any money she earned to the pimp. Id. at 221-22. Lawson and Olewnik left the first pimp and went to another  pimp after a few weeks, and they again prostituted to make money for the new pimp. Id. at 222. Olewnik wanted to  get her daughter back, so Lawson sent Olewnik to a pimp she knew who may be able to help Olewnik; Olewnik  stayed at that location until November of 2011. Id. at 222-23. A few weeks before Thanksgiving, Olewnik met up  with Mayberry and started prostituting and giving the money she earned to Mayberry. Id. at 223-24. Olewnik left  Mayberry after a month to stay with Lawson and her boyfriend, and she eventually sought treatment again at  Friends in the spring of 2012. Id. at 225-26. Since her stay at Friends in 2012, Olewnik has continued to use  marijuana with her mother, but she has stayed out [*21]  of prostitution and stopped using any other drugs. Id. at  226-27. Olewnik estimated that while she was with Defendant, she worked almost every day for Defendant, earned  approximately $50,000 as a prostitute for Defendant, and all that money went to Defendant. Id. at 228. The Government also presented testimonies of individuals who worked with Olewnik at the Walter Hoving Home  and Friends Hospital. Susan Hinton (Hinton) is the Deputy Director of the Walter Hoving Home (Home) in Garrison,  New York. Id. at 403. The Home is a facility that tries to help women through Biblical principles, job skills training,  and a safe, loving environment. Id. at 404. Olewnik entered the Home in June of 2011 for assistance. Id. at 405. At  that time, Olewnik\\'s two-year-old daughter was living with her mother, the child\\'s grandmother. Id. at 406-07. Hinton  testified that when Olewnik came to the Home, Olewnik had a lot of emotional and anger issues. Id. at 407-08.  Olewnik left the Home in August of 2011 voluntarily. Id. at 408. Antoine Hall (Hall) is a clinical social worker at Friends Hospital (Friends). Id. at 134. Friends is an acute psychiatric  hospital, and it treats individuals who have dual diagnoses, meaning the person has a drug or alcohol problem as  well as mental health issues. Id. at 411. As part of Olewnik\\'s [*22]  treatment team at Friends, Hall learned that  Olewnik had been admitted to Friends several times, starting as early as age 13 or 14. Id. at 412-14. Hall testified  that she had been more recently admitted on August 31, 2011. Id. at 416-17. At the time she was admitted, she  said she had been physically abused by her ex-boyfriend turned pimp. Id. at 418. Additionally, Olewnik admitted  Page 10 of 21   having a history of using crack cocaine, intravenous cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol, and that she had been sober  of drugs and alcohol at least two months prior to her admission at Friends. Id. at 419. She had last worked as a  prostitute on June 18, 2011, had completed the ninth grade, and her two-year-old daughter still lived with her  mother — the child\\'s grandmother. Id. at 420. Olewnik also told staff at Friends that she had suicidal thoughts and  had been prostituted, pimped out, and mistreated, as well as \"[p]hysically, emotionally and mentally abused by a  pimp.\" Id. at 423-27, 432, 434-35. Olewnik requested to be admitted to Keystone, which is an inpatient  rehabilitation center, where she had been admitted in the past. Id. at 423. Olewnik\\'s mother, Sharon Olewnik White (White), testified at trial that Olewnik\\'s father used to beat White, and she  eventually obtained a restraining order against him. Id. at 381-82. Olewnik [*23]  grew up with emotional and anger  issues, which White attributed to the fact that Olewnik witnessed her father physically abusing White. Id. at 382-83.  White also testified that Olewnik cried a lot because her father was never there when Olewnik needed him. Id. at  384. Due to this strained relationship, White believes that Olewnik is looking for a father figure in her relationships  with men. Id. Olewnik\\'s mother also testified about Olewnik\\'s emotional issues, as she cries often, gets angry easily,  and suffers from both depression and anxiety. Id. at 385. White discussed Olewnik\\'s mental health treatment, testifying that Olewnik was first admitted to a treatment center  in third grade and was again hospitalized in ninth grade. Id. at 386-87. Olewnik stayed in a shelter for a period of  time when her daughter was born, and she eventually moved back in with White. Id. at 388-91. White testified that  Olewnik continued to lash out at White after moving back, and Olewnik stole money and used marijuana and  cocaine. Id. at 391. White admitted using marijuana with Olewnik. Id. at 393-94. In 2010, Olewnik was again admitted for mental health treatment, this time at Friends. Id. at 394. White recalled that  Olewnik left the house and joined Defendant for a long period of time. Id. at 395-96. During that [*24]  period of  time, when White spoke on the phone with Olewnik, Olewnik would tell her mother that Defendant hit her; and on  one phone call in particular, Olewnik was crying heavily and telling White she wanted to come home. Id. at 398-99.  White said that she responded to Olewnik that Olewnik could come home, but she could only do so if she was going  to be a mother to her baby girl, which would include ending her illegal activities. Id. at 396-97. Lawson, who was indicted as a co-defendant in this case, testified that she entered into a plea agreement with the  Government, which, in pertinent part, provided that in exchange for her cooperation and testimony for the  Government at Defendant\\'s trial, Lawson hoped to obtain a lesser sentence. Id. at 453. Lawson told the jury that she became engaged in prostitution when she was 17, working for an individual named  Joanie Martin. Id. at 456-57. Lawson first met Defendant in Hot Springs, Arkansas, in December of 2010 or early  January of 2011, when he called in response to a prostitution ad Lawson had posted on Backpage.com. Id. at  455-58. Lawson said that when they met, he took her out on a date and did not mention prostitution. Id. at 458.  The next day, Defendant asked Lawson to come with him, promising her he would [*25]  better her life and would  make sure she did not have to worry about anything anymore. Id. at 459. Defendant made Lawson believe that he  wanted to have a romantic relationship with her, telling her she was beautiful and smart, and that she could have  children, happiness, trust, and loyalty with him. Id. at 460. Lawson testified that Defendant never mentioned to her  that he was involved in the prostitution business. Id. at 462-63. Lawson left with the Defendant and went to the motel in Little Rock where Defendant was staying. At that time, she  first learned that she would be joining Defendant\\'s group of girls — Olewnik and Mayberry. Id. at 461-62. Before  meeting Olewnik and Mayberry, Lawson had no idea that Defendant was a pimp or that he expected Lawson to  prostitute for him. Id. at 462. On the night that Lawson joined the group, Lawson stayed in one room and had sex  with Defendant, while Mayberry and Olewnik stayed in separate rooms. Id. at 465-68. The next morning, Defendant  went to Mayberry\\'s and Olewnik\\'s rooms and discovered that they \"ran away\" and took some of Defendant\\'s  belongings, including the computer Defendant used for posting prostitution ads. Id. at 465-68, 479. Lawson  testified that Defendant spent the next several days trying to convince Olewnik and Mayberry [*26]  to return.  During that time, she and Defendant continued to have a personal, intimate relationship, and that Defendant  continued to make promises to her that he would take care of her and they would have a future together. Id. at 472. Page 11 of 21   About two weeks into their relationship, Defendant, who had left Lawson at her grandparent\\'s home while he looked  for Olewnik and Mayberry, returned and had run out of money. Id. at 472-73. Defendant asked Lawson to start  prostituting for him. Id. at 473. When Lawson agreed, Defendant rented two hotel rooms, posted Lawson\\'s ad on  Backpage.com, and gave her instructions about what she needed to do as his prostitute. Id. at 472-73. Defendant  told Lawson she was not allowed to talk to other pimps or to sleep with black men. Id. at 473. She was not even  allowed to make eye contact with others in the business, and she was not allowed to talk to other prostitutes without  Defendant\\'s permission. Id. at 481. Defendant determined the pricing for Lawson\\'s services. and Lawson was  required to give all of the money to Defendant. Id. at 474-75. At this time, Lawson was still in a relationship with  Defendant, and she was starting to fall in love with him. Id. Lawson described that Defendant had made her his  \"Bottom Bitch\" — his assistant or second-in-command [*27]  for purposes of running the \"business.\" Id. at 478.  Lawson and the other girls were required to post every day for purposes of advertising to engage in commercial  sex acts to make Defendant money. Id. at 479. Lawson testified that Defendant convinced Olewnik to come back to  him by promising her that everything would be better, that he would keep her safe and care for her, that she could  come home to \"Daddy.\" Id. at 487. Defendant had Lawson communicate similar promises to others to convince  them to join the group as well. Id. at 491-92. Lawson testified that she, Defendant, Mayberry, and Olewnik traveled as a group for purposes of prostitution  throughout the country, including through Iowa, and that they occasionally met up with other pimps. Id. at 481-83.  Lawson confirmed at trial that Defendant, Lawson, and Olewnik stayed in Des Moines, Iowa, from May 11, 2011,  through May 17, 2011, and that during their stay, Olewnik and Lawson were posted for and performed commercial  sex acts, and that they again gave all money they earned to Defendant. Id. at 510-13. Larson also testified that on  a trip to Denver, Colorado, at Defendant\\'s direction, Lawson got a tattoo of one of Defendant\\'s pimp nicknames,  \"Bam.\" Id. at 487. Lawson described that when a prostitute has a tattoo [*28]  of her pimp\\'s name, \"[s]he\\'s  branded\" and others know that the prostitute belongs to the pimp. Id. at 487-88. Lawson left Defendant for a brief period of time. Lawson said that she returned, however, after Defendant told her  how much he wanted her to come back to him, and that he loved her, he was there for her, and she was still his girl.  Id. at 503. Near the end of her time with Defendant in 2011, Lawson learned that Defendant had made similar  promises to Mayberry and Olewnik before moving on to Lawson. Id. at 504. In early June 2011, while the group was in Shreveport and Bossier, Louisiana, Olewnik was arrested for  prostitution. Id. at 527. Lawson and Defendant left the Shreveport area and went to Texarkana because Lawson  had been posted in the same ad as Olewnik, and Defendant was concerned law enforcement would come to the  hotel looking for Lawson. Id. at 517-18. While Olewnik was in jail, Lawson invited her friend T.A. and T.A.\\'s kids to  join her and Defendant at the hotel for the weekend. Id. at 523. Lawson testified that she invited T.A. with the  intention of leaving with T.A. to get away from Defendant. Id. at 523. At some point during that weekend, Lawson  and Defendant went back to Shreveport to pick up Olewnik, who Defendant bailed out of jail, and the [*29]  three of  them returned to the hotel in Texarkana. Id. at 524. Shortly after that, Defendant left with T.A. and T.A.\\'s kids to  drop off the kids and then T.A. and Defendant returned to the hotel in Texarkana. Id. at 525-26. Around June 11, 2011, T.A. met up with her sister, Addison, in Hot Springs; Defendant took the rental car and  picked up both T.A. and Addison. Id. at 535. Lawson and Defendant took photos of Addison at the pool on the first  night Addison was with the group, and they posted her in Texarkana. Id. at 536. Lawson testified that Defendant  spoke with Addison about prostitution, but it was always when Defendant was alone with Addison. Id. Lawson did  witness Defendant threatening the girls that if they ever told the police about him, he would harm the girl and her  family; Addison, who had a young daughter, was present for this warning. Id. at 542, 580-81. Defendant instructed Lawson to teach Addison how to work as a prostitute in preparation for any calls she would  have in the future. Id. at 536-37. Defendant and Lawson described Addison as \"green,\" because she was new to  the prostitution business. Id. at 581. Lawson also learned during her time training Addison that Addison did not  want to perform commercial sex acts. Id. at 583-84. From Texarkana, Defendant, Olewnik, [*30]  Lawson, and Addison traveled to Fayetteville for prostitution on June  13 and 14, 2011. Id. at 537-38, 542. Although Addison was posted for sex acts in Fayetteville, she did not go on  Page 12 of 21   any calls. Id. at 540. From Fayetteville, the group traveled to Des Moines, where all three girls were again posted  for sex acts on June 15, 16, and 17, 2011. Id. at 543, 545, 548. In Des Moines, Olewnik was also posted for a  \"Backyard Special.\" Id. at 545. On June 17, 2011, Lawson and Addison were posted for a \"2 Girl Special,\" meaning  the client can engage in sex acts with both women at the same time. Id. at 549. Lawson and Addison received a  call for that type of posting in Des Moines, and Addison engaged in sex acts for money for the first time. Id. at 553- 54. By June 18, 2011, the group was in Omaha, and ads of Lawson, Olewnik, and Addison had been posted for  commercial sex acts. Id. at 550-51, 208-09. Defendant, Lawson, and Addison stayed in one room, while Olewnik  had her own room. Id. at 559. On June 18, 2011, Olewnik took a call from a client that turned out to be SA Brewer.  Id. Law enforcement questioned all four of them; Defendant and Olewnik were arrested. Id. at 559-60. Lawson and  Addison were questioned by the agents and agreed to cooperate with the investigation. Id. at 633. Lawson said that  after the raid, she observed [*31]  Addison as Addison was questioned by the agents, and described Addison as  being \"very, very upset\" and \"terrified.\" Id. at 583. Lawson also testified that Addison did not want to perform  commercial sex acts and that Defendant had threatened all the woman, including Addison, that \"if anybody ever  snitched on him, he would harm them and their family.\" Id. at 582. Lawson was asked about Olewnik\\'s relationship with Defendant and testified that Olewnik was in love with  Defendant. Id. at 618-19. She also testified that Defendant made Olewnik perform the \"Backyard Special\" on many  occasions. Id. at 530-31. Lawson confirmed that Olewnik was forced by Defendant to perform anal sex for money,  including on June 16, 2011, when Olewnik\\'s ad was posted in Des Moines. Id. at 624. Lawson witnessed Defendant  get mad at Olewnik for little things, had \"thrown her on the floor,\" \"smack her for doing stuff,\" and in other ways  physically abused Olewnik. Id. at 620. Defendant also told Lawson about several times he had physically abused  Olewnik, including when he beat Olewnik in the bathtub and another time where he and a friend \"ran a train\" on  Olewnik, meaning both men had sex with Olewnik in quick succession. Id. at 620-21. Lawson heard Defendant  regularly threaten to hit Olewnik [*32]  and to harm her daughter. Id. at 621-22. He would make such threats  especially when Olewnik told Defendant she did not want to perform sex acts for money, including the \"Backyard  Special.\" Id. at 622-23. Lawson testified that Olewnik was very easily influenced and manipulated, as she \"had the  mind of a child.\" Id. at 623. Lawson also testified that the Defendant spoke often to his own mother, who also was  involved in prostitution. Id. at 476. Lawson said that Defendant\\'s mother also talked to Lawson on the phone,  telling her to take care of her son, that Lawson was part of the family, and that Lawson did not need to talk to law  enforcement about Defendant. Id. at 476-78, 679-80. Mayberry also testified at trial. She described that as a young girl, she was mentally, physically, and verbally  abused by her family, including her grandparents and her mother. Id. at 722. She was also raped as a child. Id. at  722-23. Because her parents were in and out of prison due to their drug use, legal custody was given to her  grandmother for a period of time. Id. at 723. When she was fourteen, Mayberry attempted suicide and was  hospitalized, and her grandmother subsequently gave up legal custody of Mayberry to the State of Arkansas. Id. at  723-24. Mayberry was placed in a foster home, and she soon began using marijuana, [*33]  cocaine, and other  controlled substances. Id. at 724. Mayberry ran away from foster care when she was sixteen and began prostituting  herself and living on the streets. Id. at 725. When Mayberry met Olewnik and Defendant in Little Rock, Mayberry was eighteen, engaged in prostitution, using  drugs, homeless, and barely getting by on her own. Id. at 726-28. Mayberry accepted Olewnik\\'s invitation to meet  Defendant, who Olewnik described as her pimp. Id. at 728. At their first meeting, Defendant suggested that  Mayberry join them in the prostitution business. Id. He promised her that it would be better for her to join them and  that if they made enough money, they could stop prostituting. Id. at 729. He also promised Mayberry that when the  prostituting was over, he wanted to be with her and only her. Id. Mayberry was somewhat concerned about joining Defendant, as she saw Olewnik had belt welts on her body. Id. at  729-30. Olewnik warned Mayberry that when she met Defendant she could not lie to him, referring to Defendant as  \"Daddy.\" Id. Mayberry still joined the Defendant, and she immediately became his \"Bottom Bitch.\" Id. at 730-31. Page 13 of 21   At the beginning of Mayberry\\'s time with Defendant and Olewnik, Defendant wrote poetry for Mayberry with  promises that the girls could retire [*34]  after they made enough money, and how it would be just Defendant and  Mayberry together after it was all over. Id. at 733. Mayberry started falling for Defendant, and she thought he felt the  same way. Id. Defendant told Mayberry he was not married, that his daughter\\'s mom was his ex-wife, and that they  were divorced. Id. at 733-34. Mayberry testified about the abusive treatment Olewnik endured while working for Defendant, including the incident  on the first day Mayberry joined Defendant where Defendant accused Olewnik of lying to him, Olewnik threatened  to call the police, and Defendant hit Olewnik over and over again. Id. at 735. Mayberry said that Olewnik cried and  asked Defendant to stop, but he beat her into the bathroom and she ended up in the bathtub. Id. at 735-36.  Defendant would not stop beating Olewnik until Mayberry finally told him to stop. Id. at 737. Mayberry did not  witness other attacks, but she knew Defendant was abusing Olewnik because of the bruises on Olewnik\\'s body. Id.  at 736. Defendant instructed Mayberry that while she worked for him, she was not allowed to look at or talk to other  pimps. Id. at 740. Mayberry described that when Lawson joined the group, Mayberry and Olewnik left Defendant, as they knew that  he had made promises to both [*35]  of them and that he would likely make the same promises to Lawson. Id. at  751-53. Mayberry described Olewnik at trial as not being as smart as Mayberry, because Olewnik\\'s mind was like  that of a child, not really based in reality. Id. at 753-54. After leaving Defendant, Mayberry said that the two girls  continued performing commercial sex acts, and that she kept control of any money they earned. Id. at 754. During  their time together, both girls used opiates, marijuana, and cocaine, and they purchased these drugs with the  money they made through prostitution. Id. at 754-55. Mayberry hit Olewnik on one occasion, and shortly after that  altercation, Olewnik left Mayberry to go back to Defendant. Id. at 756. A short time later, Mayberry returned to  Defendant because of promises he made through letters, saying that he missed her and wanted her back with him.  Id. at 757-59. Mayberry left Defendant before June of 2011, so she never came in contact with Addison. Id. at 761. Addison testified that she met Defendant in Texarkana, but at that time, she was living in Hot Springs. Id. at 798.  Addison was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when she was thirteen, and she has a daughter who is currently four  years old, making her about two years old when Addison met Defendant in 2011. Id. at 798-99. When [*36]   Addison met Defendant, she had never engaged in prostitution, and she thought she was joining her sister, T.A.,  and T.A.\\'s friends to party for the weekend. Id. at 799. On the first day Addison joined the group, she saw the other  girls post pictures online, and she later learned they were posting the photos to Backpage.com for prostitution. Id.  at 800. She testified that when she left Hot Springs to join the group in Texarkana, she did not know they were  engaged in prostitution. Id. at 800-01. Later that day, Addison went to the gas station with Defendant, where he told her he wanted her to work for him as  a prostitute. Id. at 801-02. Defendant told Addison she could not go home, and if she talked to the police he would  hurt her and her family. Id. at 802. Defendant required Addison to change her cell phone number, telling Addison  that \"nobody needed to have [Addison\\'s] phone number except for tricks.\" Id. at 811. Addison did not remember being posted for prostitution in Texarkana, but she knows she was posted on  Backpage.com, in Fayetteville, which was their next stop. Id. Addison testified that she was posted against her will,  as she did not want to engage in prostitution. Id. at 802-03. She testified that T.A. voluntarily posed for pictures for  Backpage.com [*37]  postings in June of 2011. Id. at 803-04. Addison testified that when the group traveled from  Texarkana to Fayetteville, it was at Defendant\\'s direction, and he drove the car. Id. at 805-06. Defendant made it  clear that Addison was not allowed to leave, even though she missed her daughter, because he also did not get to  go home to his children. Id. at 806-07. In Fayetteville, Defendant posted Addison on Backpage.com, but she did not  want him to post her. Id. at 807-08. She said that it appeared most of the photos Defendant posted of her were from  her Facebook page. Id. at 810. In addition to posting Addison online, Defendant made Addison change her phone  number so it would only be used for prostitution calls. Id. at 811. He also kept possession of her phone unless she  was answering prostitution calls or talking to her mother in a supervised setting. Id. at 812. After a few days in Fayetteville, the group traveled to Des Moines for prostitution. Id. at 813. In Des Moines,  Addison was posted by Defendant for a two-girl special with Lawson, and she engaged in a commercial sex act for  Page 14 of 21   a customer along with Lawson on June 17, 2011. Id. at 814-15, 819-20. The money earned from that act of  prostitution went to Defendant. Id. at 815. Addison testified that she did not want to participate in the sex act, but  she [*38]  felt like she had to because Defendant told her she could not go home, and she would rather work for  Defendant than put her family in danger. Id. at 816. While she was in Des Moines, Addison attempted to manipulate  Defendant into letting her go home, but she was unable to do so. Id. at 820. She stayed with Defendant to protect  herself, her family, and especially her daughter. Id. Additionally, she did not even know where she was, as she was  not familiar with the cities she was visiting, so she was unsure how to get police help. Id. Defendant even ordered  Addison that she was not allowed to talk to the other girls about how she wanted to go home or about the fact that  Defendant wanted to make her his new \"Bottom Bitch.\" Id. at 828-29. In addition to Defendant making Addison engage in prostitution, Addison testified that she also engaged in sexual  activity with Defendant involuntarily, because she was scared of him and thought she had to do anything he told her  to do. Id. at 829-30. Addison saw Olewnik and Defendant argue multiple times, and she knew he threatened to hit  Olewnik in the past. Id. at 831. Defendant used to tell Olewnik that her family did not care about her, and that she  was doing more for her daughter by prostituting herself [*39]  for Defendant than by going home to her child. Id.  Additionally, Addison witnessed Lawson tell Defendant about something Olewnik refused to do, and Defendant  started talking about physically abusing Olewnik. Id. During their travels, Defendant told Olewnik, Lawson, and  Addison that if they were caught by the police and tried to snitch on him, he would kill the girls and their families,  and that for every year he was locked up, he would make sure a member of their family was killed. Id. at 832. After  spending one week with Defendant, Lawson, and Olewnik, Addison observed that Lawson and Defendant had a  \"messed up relationship,\" and that Defendant treated Olewnik as \"his slave.\" Id. at 834. After a few days in Des Moines, the group traveled to Omaha for prostitution. Id. at 820-21. Defendant made this  decision and he transported the girls from Des Moines to Omaha. Id. at 821. On June 18, 2011, when the group  was in Omaha, Addison confirmed that the police broke up the group after Olewnik was busted by an undercover  police officer. Id. at 823. During their testimonies, all four women identified various photographs of themselves that  had been posted on Backpage.com for the purpose of advertising commercial sex acts. Tr. 199, 528, 699- 700, [*40]  745, 804. a. Counts 1 through 3 Defendant contends in his post-trial motions that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\\'s conclusion  beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant knew or acted in reckless disregard to the fact that force, threats of  force, fraud, or coercion caused any of the alleged victims to engage in commercial sex acts. HN2[ ] To establish that Defendant conspired to commit sex trafficking or to knowingly benefit from sex  trafficking, the Government must prove: (1) two or more persons reached an agreement or came to an  understanding, in or affecting interstate commerce, to commit sex trafficking; (2) Defendant voluntarily and  intentionally joined in the agreement or understanding, either at the time it was first reached, or at some later time  while it was still in effect; (3) at the time Defendant joined in the agreement or understanding, Defendant knew the  purpose of the agreement or understanding; and (4) while the agreement or understanding was in effect, a person  or persons who had joined in the agreement or understanding knowingly did one or more overt acts for the purpose  of carrying out or carrying forward the agreement or understanding. 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a)(1) and 1591(b)(1). HN3[ ] To establish [*41]  that Defendant committed the underlying crime of sex trafficking, the Government  must prove: (1) Defendant knowingly (a) recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, or  maintained, by any means a person, or (b) benefitted, financially or by receiving anything of value, from  participating in a venture that recruited, enticed, transported, provided, or obtained a person, or attempted to so  benefit; (2) the acts were in or affected interstate commerce; and (3) Defendant knew or had reckless disregard of  the fact that force, threats of force, fraud, and coercion would be used to cause the person or persons to engage  in a commercial sex act. 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a), 1591(a)(1), 1591(a)(2), 1591(b)(1), and 2. Page 15 of 21   The jury is instructed in the disjunctive form used in the statute, because \"[p]roof of any one of the violations  charged conjunctively in the indictment will sustain a conviction.\" United States v. Urkevich, 408 F.3d 1031, 1036  (8th Cir. 2005) (quoting United States v. Klein, 850 F.2d 404, 406 (8th Cir. 1988)). Thus, the Government needed  only prove that Defendant used force or threats of force or fraud or coercion to cause any of the alleged victims to  engage in commercial sex acts. Jury Instruction 20 defined \"force\" as \"any form of power, violence, or physical pressure directed against another  person,\" and \"power\" as \"dominance, control or [*42]  influence.\" Final Jury Instr. 20, ECF No. 131. Sufficient  evidence was presented to the jury to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant exhibited force or  threats of force to cause Olewnik and Addison to commit commercial sex acts. Olewnik had never engaged in prostitution before becoming involved with Defendant. When Defendant recruited  Olewnik, he knew she had recently been released from the hospital and had a history of mental health issues.  Defendant knew Olewnik had a young daughter that had been put in the custody of Olewnik\\'s mother due to  Olewnik\\'s drug use. Defendant knew Olewnik\\'s circumstances of instability and rejection, and made promises to  care for and protect Olewnik and to help Olewnik get her daughter back. Once Olewnik agreed to go with Defen- dant, he immediately took Olewnik, who had no money of her own, hundreds of miles away from her family, leaving  Olewnik little option but to stay with Defendant. By the time Olewnik could have known Defendant\\'s promises were  insincere, Olewnik was entrenched in what the Government called a \"climate of violence,\" essentially being  compelled to continue prostituting herself for Defendant\\'s benefit. Olewnik testified [*43]  that if she went against  Defendant\\'s wishes, was disloyal, or was disrespectful in any way, Defendant would physically abuse her. Thus,  Olewnik sought to please Defendant in any way he wished, including performing commercial sex acts in any city to  which Defendant brought her for his financial benefit. This testimony was corroborated by Mayberry, Lawson,  Addison, and the Friends Hospital records from Olewnik\\'s stay in August 2011. Defendant argues that during the course of working for him, Olewnik left him a few times and voluntarily came back,  which demonstrates that Olewnik was free to leave. The evidence presented at trial demonstrated that Olewnik  came back due to her loyalty to Defendant, the love she had for Defendant, and his promises of love and a future  with him. In addition, when Olewnik would ask to come back, she was hundreds of miles away from her family, had  no money, and in one instance, she did not even have clothes to wear. The record was replete with evidence that  Defendant knew Olewnik was vulnerable and used that knowledge to force Olewnik to continue engaging in  commercial sex acts for Defendant\\'s benefit. The Government presented similar evidence regarding Addison. [*44]  When Addison met Defendant, she thought  she was joining her sister and her sister\\'s friends for a weekend of partying. Addison had never been a prostitute  before meeting Defendant. Like Olewnik, Addison had a young daughter and was miles away from her home and  family when Defendant asked Addison to be a prostitute for him. Addison testified that Defendant told her that she  was not allowed to go home or talk to the police because he would hurt her and her family if she went against him.  Tr. 802. He made it clear to Addison that she could not go home and that she had to prostitute for him, including  making her change her cell phone number, only allowing her to use her cell phone for prostitution calls; any  conversations with her family were supervised. Defendant had Addison stay in his room with Lawson and had  Lawson training Addison. Defen-dant also controlled what Addison talked about with the other girls working for him.  Id. at 807, 811-12. Addison said that she felt she was not free to go home and that she had to engage in  commercial sex acts for Defendant\\'s benefit because she was scared he would hurt her family if she did not do so.  Id. at 813, 816, 820. She also thought she and her family would be harmed by Defendant [*45]  if she talked to the  police. Id. at 832. The record also contains sufficient evidence for the jury to have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant  used fraud, that is, he made promises he knew were false at the time he made them, to Olewnik, Lawson,  Mayberry, and Addison to persuade them to engage in com-mercial sex acts for his benefit. Jury Instruction 20  defined \"fraud\" as \"any deliberate act of deception, trickery or misrepresentation.\" Final Jury Instr. 20, ECF No. 131. Despite the fact that Defendant was married and had a small child during the entire time he was with the women in  this case, he made separate promises to each one — Olewnik, Mayberry, and Lawson — that he loved her, he  Page 16 of 21   wanted to have a future with her, and he was planning to divorce his wife. The evidence demonstrated that  Defendant made these false promises to convince each woman to prostitute herself for his benefit. Defendant promised Olewnik that if she prostituted for him, he would get her daughter back. Instead of ever getting  her daughter back, Defendant moved Olewnik hundreds of miles away from her daughter. As stated, Olewnik did  leave Defendant a few times but came back to him to engage in prostitution for [*46]  his benefit out of loyalty and  respect for Defendant and in hopes he would keep his promises and that they would have a future together. Id. at  163-64. Defendant made similar promises to Mayberry and Lawson. Id. at 119, 303-04, 459-60, 471-72, 503-04,  587-88, 729, 732-33, 733-34, 758. The record also contains sufficient evidence for the jury to have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant  used coercion to persuade the women to engage in commercial sex acts for his benefit. Jury Instruction 20  defined \"coercion\" for purposes of sex trafficking as: [A]ny threat of serious harm to or physical restraint against any person; or, any scheme, plan, or pattern  intended to cause a person to believe that failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to or physical  restraint against any person; or, any abuse or threatened abuse of law or the legal process. Final Jury Instr. 20, ECF No. 131. Additionally, Jury Instruction 20 defined \"threat of serious harm\" as set forth in the definition of \"coercion\" as: Threats of serious harm, . . . includes threats of both physical and non-physical types of harm. Non-physical  threats of serious harm include, among other threats, threats of psychological, financial or reputational harm.  Threats of serious harm include threats of any consequences, [*47]  whether physical or non-physical, that are  sufficient, under all the surrounding circumstances, to compel or coerce a reasonable person of the same  background and in the same circumstances to perform commercial sex acts that the person would not have  otherwise been willing to perform. Id. Olewnik testified that she hated performing \"Backyard Specials\" - anal sex for clients — specifically stating that it  hurt, but that she continued to perform this commercial sex act to make money for Defendant and to prevent him  from physically abusing her. Tr. 197-98, 620-23. Lawson and Mayberry corroborated Olewnik\\'s testimony, each  noting Olewnik\\'s objection to performing anal sex and that Defendant would threaten harm to Olewnik and to her  family, including Olewnik\\'s young daughter, if Olewnik did not perform anal sex for clients. Addison also testified that she did not want to commit any commercial sex acts for Defen-dant\\'s financial benefit,  but that she felt like she had to because she was afraid Defendant would harm her, her daughter, and the rest of  her family if she refused. Id. at 802, 806-07, 814-16, 820. Defendant argues the absence of threats, coercion, fraud, or force is evidenced by the fact that the women left  him [*48]  at different times and voluntarily chose to return and voluntarily chose to commit commercial sex acts  for his financial benefit. The record contains sufficient evidence to the contrary. The evidence submitted at trial  supports a jury finding that Defendant targeted women who came from broken families, had no home to return to,  had mental health issues, were drug abusers, or had other vulnerabilities that made them more susceptible to his  promises of love and security and more willing to succumb to his coercive tactics. This is especially true as to  Olewnik. Mayberry, Lawson, and Olewnik\\'s mother all testified about Olewnik\\'s child-like nature and that she  obeyed Defendant\\'s commands and was desperate for Defendant\\'s approval. Based on the evidence in this record,  a reasonable jury could have concluded that Olewnik — as well as Mayberry, Lawson, and Addison — had different  vulnerabilities that allowed them to simultaneously fear Defendant and yet seek to stay with him instead of walking  away permanently. This Court finds that the Government presented sufficient evidence for the jury to reason-ably conclude that  Defendant\\'s use of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion compelled [*49]  Olewnik or Addison to engage in  commercial sex acts for Defendant\\'s financial benefit as set forth in Counts 2 and 3 of the Superseding Indictment. Page 17 of 21   As to Count 1, the evidence was sufficient to show that, at any given time, Defendant con-spired with or entered  into an understanding with his \"Bottom Bitch,\" as well as other pimps, to compel women to perform commercial  sex acts for the financial benefit of the women\\'s respec-tive pimp. Defendant had other pimps\\' prostitutes train  Olewnik, and he had his \"Bottom Bitch\" at the time — Lawson — train Addison how to perform as a prostitute.  Defendant worked with other pimps and his \"Bottom Bitches\" to train women and keep the women under his  control, even if he was not around. This Court finds that the Government presented sufficient evidence for a  reasonable jury to conclude that Defendant entered into agreements or understandings with other individuals for the  purpose of committing sex trafficking, as set forth in Count 1 of the Superseding Indictment. b. Counts 4 through 7 HN4[ ] In order to establish guilt of the crime of coercion and enticement to travel in interstate commerce for  prostitution, as set forth in Counts 4 through 7, the Government [*50]  had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt at  trial that Defendant knowingly attempted to or actually persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced any person or  persons to travel in interstate commerce to engage in prostitution. 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422(a) and 2. In his post-trial  motions, Defendant asserts that the Government failed to present sufficient evidence to support the allegations in  Counts 4 through 7 that Defendant persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced any other person to travel in interstate  commerce to perform commercial sex acts. Rather, Defendant contends that the evidence pre-sented at trial  showed that the prostitutes who worked for him traveled in interstate commerce to perform commercial sex acts  voluntarily, and that they did so for other pimps before or after their time with Defendant. As set forth in Jury Instruction 23, \"[a]n act is done knowingly if the defendant is aware of the act and does not act  through ignorance, mistake, or accident.\" Final Jury Instr. 23, ECF No. 131. \"Attempt\" is defined in Jury Instruction  21 as intending to commit sex trafficking, and \"voluntarily and intentionally carr[ying] out some act which was the  substantial step toward engaging in sex trafficking.\" Id. 21. Jury Instruction 26 defines [*51]  \"induce\" to mean \"to  lead on to some action, prevail on\" so as to provide some type of \"motive or incentive\" to act. Id. 26. \"Entice\" is  defined in Jury Instruction 26 as \"attract by offering hope of reward or pleasure.\" Id. 26. Finally, \"coerce\" is set forth  in Jury Instruction 26 as \"to achieve by force or threats.\" Id. 26. To convict Defendant of the charges set forth in Counts 4 through 7, the jury had to find that Defendant either  attempted or followed through with the act of persuading or inducing or enticing or coercing one or more of the  women to travel in interstate commerce to commit commercial sex acts — any of those methods would be  sufficient for each individual count. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422(a) and 2. Count 4 deals with any acts committed on or  about May 11, 2011; Count 5 covers on or about May 16, 2011; Count 6 deals with on or about June 15, 2011; and  Count 7 covers on or about June 17, 2011. As set forth above, the testimony established that Olewnik traveled into  Iowa and out of Iowa for the purpose of performing commercial sex acts in mid-May of 2011, as well as from June  15 through 17 of 2011. Additionally, the evidence as set forth above established that Addison traveled into Iowa and  out of Iowa for the [*52]  purpose of performing commercial sex acts from June 15 through 17, 2011. Olewnik, Mayberry, Lawson, and Addison testified consistently that when they traveled anywhere, it was at  Defendant\\'s command. Tr. 133-34, 137-38, 164-65, 176-83, 209-10, 482-83, 496-98, 506-08, 517, 589-91, 613-17,  743-44, 758. Specifically, they testified that Defendant compelled them to travel to and from Iowa in May of 2011  and June of 2011 around the dates specified in Counts 4 through 7 of the Superseding Indictment. Id. at 180-82,  209-10. This Court finds that, per the above discussion regarding Defendant\\'s use of force, threats of force, fraud,  or coercion, a reasonable jury could have concluded that Defendant was able to coerce, if not also persuade,  entice, or induce, Olewnik and Addison to travel to and from Iowa on the dates specified in Counts 4 through 7 of  the Superseding Indictment for the purpose of performing commercial sex acts. B. Motion for New Trial 1. Standard for Motion for New Trial Page 18 of 21   HN5[ ] \"Upon the defendant\\'s motion, the court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of  justice so requires.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a). \"A district court may grant a new trial under Rule 33 only if the evidence  weighs so heavily against the verdict [*53]  that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred.\" United States v.  McClellon, 578 F.3d 846, 857 (8th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). \"When faced with a motion for new trial, . . . a  district court is permitted to weigh the evidence and judge witness credibility for itself in determining if there may  have been a miscarriage of justice such that a new trial is required.\" United States v. Samuels, 543 F.3d 1013,  1019 (8th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted). Although the Court has broad discretion in deciding a motion for new trial, it  \"must exercise the Rule 33 authority sparingly and with caution.\" McClellon, 578 F.3d at 857 (quotation marks and  citation omitted). Defendant argues in his motion for new trial that the jury\\'s verdict was against the weight of the evidence in Counts  1 through 7, as \"the evidence does not establish that force, threats of force, coercion or fraud were used to induce  any person to engage in commercial sex acts,\" or \"that Mr. Bell persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced any  person to travel in interstate com-merce to perform commercial sex acts.\" Def.\\'s 2d Mot. 2, ECF No. 136. 2. Evidence Presented at Trial As set forth in the prior discussion, the evidence at trial was sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict Defendant as  to every Count in the Superseding Indictment, given his attorney\\'s con-cession that Defendant [*54]  was guilty of  Counts 8 through 12. Defendant is also unable to demon-strate that the weight of the evidence at trial was against  the jury\\'s verdict convicting him. Although Olewnik worked as a prostitute for other individuals at different times  after she met Defendant, this fact fails to negate or outweigh the conclusion that she was compelled to prosti-tute  herself for Defendant\\'s benefit as a consequence of his promises, threats, and physical abuse. The Court may  weigh the credibility of the witnesses for purposes of a motion for new trial, and it finds here that Olewnik\\'s  testimony about Defendant physically and psychologically abusing her is credible, especially given the  corroborating testimony by Mayberry, Lawson, and Addison. This physical and psychological abuse created a  climate of violence wherein Olewnik, and most likely the other women working for Defendant, felt compelled to  perform commercial sex acts at Defendant\\'s request to avoid retribution by Defendant. Denial of a new trial would result in no serious miscarriage of justice. The weight of the evidence supported the  jury\\'s verdict on every Count set forth in the Superseding Indictment. The Defendant had ample opportunity [*55]  to  thoroughly contest the Government\\'s case at trial, both through cross-examination of the Government\\'s witnesses  and through the admission of his own exhibits. The weight of the evidence supports the jury\\'s verdict, and based on  the record before it, the Court cannot upset that verdict. 3. Addition of T.A.\\'s Testimony Defendant asserts that he has discovered new evidence — T.A.\\'s testimony — and that this evidence, if admitted at  trial, would likely have produced an acquittal on Counts 1 through 7. HN6[ ] The standard for granting motions for  a new trial based on newly discovered evidence \"is rigorous because these motions are disfavored.\" United States  v. Street, 548 F.3d 618, 625 (8th Cir. 2008). In order to support a motion for new trial based on newly discovered  evidence under Rule 33, Defendant must prove \"(1) the evidence is in fact newly discovered since trial; (2) dili- gence on his part; (3) the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching; (4) the evidence is material to the  issues involved; and (5) it is probable that the new evidence would produce an acquittal at the new trial.\" United  States v. Myers, 503 F.3d 676, 682-83 (8th Cir. 2007) (citing United States v. Provost, 921 F.2d 163, 164 (8th Cir.  1990)); see also United States v. Zuazo, 243 F.3d 428, 431 (8th Cir. 2001) (holding that a defendant\\'s failure to  meet any one of the five factors set forth in Myers defeats a motion under Rule 33). The new trial remedy set [*56]   forth in Rule 33 should be used sparingly and with caution, and the trial court has broad discretion in considering  the motion. United States v. Dodd, 391 F.3d 930, 934 (8th Cir. 2004); United States v. Cannon, 88 F.3d 1495, 1502  (8th Cir. 1996). Page 19 of 21   a. Newly Discovered Evidence HN7[ ] In order to constitute \"newly discovered\" evidence for purposes of Rule 33, the evidence must not have  been known about before or during trial. United States v. Rogers, 982 F.2d 1241, 1245 (8th Cir. 1993) (holding that  when a co-defendant refrains from testifying at a joint trial, and later offers testimony exculpating a co-defendant,  the evidence is not \"newly discovered\" under Rule 33) (citation omitted); United States v. Atkins, 545 F.2d 1153,  1154 (8th Cir. 1976) (holding that the evidence at issue was not \"newly discovered,\" as the appellant\\'s counsel had  received a copy of the evidence before trial, which he could have pursued during trial had he chosen to do so). Defendant asserts that T.A.\\'s testimony is newly discovered evidence, but as Government notes in its responsive  briefs, Defendant knew T.A. in June of 2011, he knew of T.A.\\'s relation-ship with Addison, he knew about the  allegations regarding Addison as set forth in the Super-seding Indictment, and he knew that Addison was set to  testify against him at trial. T.A.\\'s existence and involvement in the case was not newly discovered by Defendant in  February of 2013; rather, the content of her testimony was [*57]  unknown simply because Defendant failed to  speak with T.A. before or during trial. This does not make her testimony newly discovered, as Defendant knew of  her existence and has produced no evidence that T.A. was unavailable at the time of trial. See United States v.  Baker, 479 F.3d 574, 578 (8th Cir. 2007) (holding that the new witness\\' \"statements do not necessitate a new trial  because there is no evidence that she was unavailable to [the defendant] at the time of trial nor any indication that  due diligence could not have uncovered this evidence at that time\" (citation omitted)). This Court finds that  Defendant has failed to prove that T.A.\\'s existence was newly discovered after trial, even though the content of her  purported testimony was learned only recently by Defendant. Thus, Defendant has failed to prove the evidence was  \"newly discovered\" for purposes of Rule 33. b. Due Diligence HN8[ ] In his attempt to obtain a new trial, Defendant bears the burden of proving that he acted diligently in  seeking the newly discovered evidence at issue. If the evidence could have been discovered by the use of due  diligence, it cannot be considered newly discovered evidence under Rule 33. Id. Even if T.A.\\'s purported testimony  constitutes \"newly discovered\" evidence, Defendant [*58]  has failed to demonstrate that he exercised due diligence  in seeking to bring forth T.A. for purposes of testifying at trial. \"Due diligence\" requires that the individual with the burden of discovering the evidence make \"a reasonable  attempt, in light of the information available at the time, to investigate and pursue\" the evidence at issue, regardless  of whether they were successful during such attempts. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 435, 120 S. Ct. 1479, 146  L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000) (setting forth the meaning of \"due diligence\" under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2)(A)(ii)); see also  United States v. Johnson, 12 F.3d 827, 834 (8th Cir. 1994) (abrogation on other grounds recognized by United  States v. Cote, 569 F.3d 391, 393 (8th Cir. 2009)) (holding that due diligence would have required the Defendant to  take action to ascertain whether an alternative perpetrator existed, rather than waiting until after trial to begin  creating his defense when he knew he was not the person who committed the crime). Defendant fails to offer any explanation as to why he did not contact T.A. until February of 2013 - months after the  end of trial. He claims in his filings that he did not know how to contact her, but this excuse is rather flimsy given the  ease of public records searches and the fact that Defendant could have turned to this Court to assist with Court- issued subpoenas for material witnesses. Defendant fails to set forth [*59]  reasons for T.A.\\'s unavailability prior to  or at trial when Defendant was able to find her in February of 2013. Thus, Defendant has failed to prove he acted  diligently prior to and at trial to procure T.A.\\'s testimony. c. Cumulative or Impeaching Page 20 of 21   HN9[ ] \"[I]n order to meet the materiality requirement, newly discovered evidence must be \\'more than merely . . .  impeaching.\\'\" United States v. Baker, 479 F.3d 574, 577 (8th Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Dogskin, 265 F.3d  682, 685 (8th Cir. 2001)). \"[T]hird party impeach-ment testimony . . . rarely, if ever, justifies a new trial on newly  discovered evidence grounds.\" Dogskin, 265 F.3d at 687 (citations omitted). Even if T.A. had testified at trial, her  purported testimony is merely cumulative or impeaching of Addison and Lawson\\'s testimony regarding whether  Defendant forced Addison to perform commercial sex acts at his direction. Addison testified at trial that she was  forced by Defendant to prostitute herself for his benefit, and that she did not want to perform sex acts for money.  Defendant asserts in his Second Motion for New Trial that T.A. would testify that Addison knew she was joining  Defendant\\'s group for the purpose of prostitution, and that she willingly participated without any use of force or  coercion by Defendant. It appears, based on T.A.\\'s purported testimony, that T.A. and [*60]  Addison\\'s testimony would have differed with  regard to Addison\\'s intent when she joined the group and whether she went out on calls in Texarkana. However,  because T.A. was not present after the group left Texarkana, T.A. would be unable to refute Addison\\'s testimony  about any threats Defendant made to Addison when the two of them were alone. Addison testified that those  threats by Defendant were the only reason she engaged in commercial sex acts for Defendant\\'s benefit.  Additionally, T.A.\\'s testimony would not change any of the evidence regarding Defendant\\'s abuse of Olewnik, which  offers a separate avenue through which the jury could reasonably have found Defendant guilty of Counts 1 through  7. Nothing in T.A.\\'s proffered testimony would exculpate Defendant, as her testimony is limited to countering her  sister\\'s testimony on two narrow issues. T.A.\\'s testimony is merely impeachment testimony, and it therefore fails to  satisfy the test for a new trial under Rule 33. d. Materiality The Government concedes that if T.A.\\'s proffered testimony is as Defendant articulates in his Second Motion for  New Trial, it would be \"material\" for purposes of the test set forth in Myers. Based on Government\\'s [*61]   concession, the Court, therefore, assumes without deciding the testimony would be material. e. Likelihood of Acquittal HN10[ ] When determining whether newly discovered evidence would probably produce an acquittal, the Court  should look at the evidence presented at the original trial and consider the impact of the newly discovered evidence.  See Allen v. Nix, 55 F.3d 414, 417 (8th Cir. 1995) (holding that \"the newly discovered evidence at issue in the  present case is insufficient to establish that petitioner is actually innocent of first degree murder since [the new]  testimony at best only tends to impeach [another witness\\'] testimony and indirectly support petitioner\\'s version of  the facts\"). Defendant asserts that T.A. would have testified that Addison knew about the prostitution operation before joining  the group and that Addison went out on calls with the girls after having T.A. make her look her best. Even if the jury  were to believe T.A.\\'s proffered testimony, she was only with Addison and the rest of the group for a few days, and  she was never present when Addison was threatened by Defendant. She was also not present when Addison was  in Des Moines, where Addison testified she engaged in commercial sex acts for the first time out of [*62]  fear of  the Defendant. Further, Counts 1 through 7 could have been satisfied by the jury finding that Defendant forced or  coerced Olewnik to commit commercial sex acts as well as to travel in interstate commerce for prostitution,  making in unnecessary for the jury to determine whether Addison participated as a prostitute willingly or due to  Defendant\\'s threats. Thus, even if Addison\\'s story is disbelieved in favor of T.A.\\'s version of the events, the jury still  could have reasonably found Defendant guilty of Counts 1 through 7. Defendant has therefore failed to prove that  the addition of T.A.\\'s alleged testimony would have probably produced an acquittal on Counts 1 through 7. Defendant has failed to establish the existence of all five factors set forth in Myers to support his motion for a new  trial under Rule 33; his motion therefore fails. Page 21 of 21           '"
