    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the final project is for you to create a **digital analytical edition** of a corpus using the tools, practices, and perspectives youâ€™ve learning in this course. You will select a corpus that has already been digitized and transcribed, parse that into an F-compliant set of tables, and then generate and visualize the results of a series of fitted models. You will also draw some tentative conclusions regarding the linguistic, cultural, psychological, or historical features represented by your corpus. The point of the exercise is to have you work with a corpus through the entire pipeline from ingestion to interpretation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you will acquire a collection of long-form texts and perform the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Convert** the collection from their source formats (F0) into a set of tables that conform to the Standard Text Analytic Data Model (F2).\n",
    "- **Annotate** these tables with statistical and linguistic features using NLP libraries such as NLTK (F3).\n",
    "- **Produce** a vector representation of the corpus to generate TFIDF values to add to the TOKEN (aka CORPUS) and VOCAB tables (F4).\n",
    "- **Model** the annotated and vectorized model with tables and features derived from the application of unsupervised methods, including PCA, LDA, and word2vec (F5).\n",
    "- **Explore** your results using statistical and visual methods.\n",
    "- **Present** conclusions about patterns observed in the corpus by means of these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are finished, you will make the results of your work available in GitHub (for code) and UVA Box (for data). You will submit to Gradescope (via Canvas) a PDF version of a Jupyter notebook that contains the information listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Some Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please fill out your answers in each task below by editing the markdown cell. \n",
    "- Replace text that asks you to insert something with the thing, i.e. replace `(INSERT IMAGE HERE)` with an image element, e.g. `![](image.png)`.\n",
    "- For URLs, just paste the raw URL directly into the text area. Don't worry about providing link labels using `[label](link)`.\n",
    "- Please do not alter the structure of the document or cell, i.e. the bulleted lists. \n",
    "- You may add explanatory paragraphs below the bulleted lists.\n",
    "- Please name your tables as they are named in each task below.\n",

They come in a mix of pdf or txt files, depending on how easy it was to parse through the text (i.e. finding chapters, paragraphs) with the entire book contents in them. They were found on the [Internet Archives](https://archive.org/) using the following Google search scheme: \"\\<book title>\" \"\\<author name>\" internet archive. However, Warrior Cats books where obtained on [Weebly](https://readwarriorbooks.weebly.com/warriors.html) using the Google search scheme: into the wild erin hunter free pdf. Then finding the link that has the pdf and/or txt file available for download.\n",

    "The first series is Warrior Cats written between the years 2003 and 2004 under a collective pseudonym, Erin Hunter. The first series is The Last Dragon Chronicles written between the years 2001 and 2013 by Chris D'Lacey. The last series is A Song of Ice and Fire (ASOIAF) written by George R.R. Martin, with the first novel being published in 1996 and the most recent novel in 2011. It is currently incomplete, so I have only obtained the works that have been completed and published (Book 1-5)."
